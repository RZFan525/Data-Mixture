The heat pump extracts heat from a natural reservoir or from groundwater and supplies it to the water in the heating system with a higher temperature. Meanwhile, the water in the heating system also serves as the cooling water for the heat engine. If 1 kg of fuel is burned, the heat obtained by the boiler is $H$, and the temperatures of the boiler, groundwater, and heating system water are 210°C, 15°C, and 60°C, respectively. Assuming both the heat engine and heat pump are reversible Carnot machines, what is the ideal amount of heat received by the heating system per 1 kg of fuel burned ?

When energy is supplied, the electron moves to higher energy orbit depending on the amount of energy absorbed. When this electron returns to any of the lower orbits, it emits energy. Lyman series is formed when the electron returns to the lowest orbit while Balmer series is formed when the electron returns to second orbit. Similarly, Paschen, Brackett and Pfund series are formed when electron returns to the third, fourth and fifth orbits from higher energy orbits respectively. The maximum number of lines produced when an electron jumps from nth level to ground level is equal Maximum number of lines produced when an electron jumps from nth level to ground level is equal to. $\\displaystyle \\:\\frac{1\\left ( n-1 \\right )}{2}.$ For example, in the case of $n= 4, $ number of lines produces is 6. $\\displaystyle \\:\\left ( 4\\rightarrow 3,4\\rightarrow 2,4\\rightarrow 1,3\\rightarrow 2,3\\rightarrow 1,2\\rightarrow 1 \\right ).$ When an electron returns from to state, the number of lines in the spectrum will be equal to $\\displaystyle \\:\\frac{\\left ( n_{2}-n_{1} \\right )\\left ( n_{2}-n_{1}+1 \\right )}{2}$ If the electron comes back from energy level having energy to energy level having energy, then the difference may be expressed in the terms of energy of photon as $\\displaystyle \\:E_{2}-E_{1}\\Delta E,\\lambda = \\frac{hc}{\\Delta E}$  Since h and c are constants, $\\Delta E$ corresponds to definite energy; thus each transition from one energy level to another will produce a light of definite wavelength.

The other end of the tube is sealed with a rigid cap. The frequency of the sound waves radiated by the piston source is 6 kHz. At a certain position in the tube, a sound pressure standing wave ratio (SWR) of 8 is measured. After moving 0.5 m towards the closed end, an SWR of 9 is recorded. Derive the expression for the sound absorption coefficient in terms of the standing wave ratio and distance, and simplify this expression when the absorption coefficient $\\alpha \\ll 1$. Based on the above measurements, calculate the corresponding value of the absorption coefficient.
