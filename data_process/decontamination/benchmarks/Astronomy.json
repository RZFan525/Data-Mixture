For two masses, $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, orbiting the centre of mass with separation $a$ with orbital angular velocity $\\omega$, then the dimensionless strain parameter $h$ is\n\n$$\nh \\simeq \\frac{G}{c^{4}} \\frac{1}{r} \\mu a^{2} \\omega^{2}\n$$\n\nwhere $r$ is the luminosity distance, $c$ is the speed of light, $\\mu=m_{1} m_{2} / M_{\\text {tot }}$ is the reduced mass and $M_{\\text {tot }}=m_{1}+m_{2}$ is the total mass.\n\nThe rate of change of frequency of the gravitational waves (called the 'chirp') from a merging binary can be written as\n\n$$\n\\dot{f}_{\\mathrm{GW}}=\\frac{96}{5} \\pi^{8 / 3}\\left(\\frac{G \\mathcal{M}}{c^{3}}\\right)^{5 / 3} f_{\\mathrm{GW}}^{11 / 3}\n$$\n\nproblem:\nc.

        "solution": "Place the tip of the stick at the center of the celestial sphere. Consider the position of the Sun at a certain fixed time of day, on different days of the year. For the same time of day, the hour angle stays the same, but the declination of the Sun varies between $\\delta=-23.5^{\\circ}$ to $23.5^{\\circ}$, encompassing an arc of a great circle passing through the celestial poles.\n\nThen, the shadow of the tip of the stick must always be in the plane containing the center and the arc. As the shadows on different days form a line, and the lines on the ground pass through the base of the stick, the base of the stick must also be in this plane.\n\n[figure1]\n\nRepeating this argument for different times of day, we get that the base of the stick must be in the intersection of planes defined by arcs at different hour angles. As all these planes pass through the North and South celestial poles, the intersection is the line joining the NCP and SCP, and the stick base must be on this line.\n\nTherefore, the stick must point (upwards) in the direction of the NCP. As the altitude of the NCP is the latitude, the NCP is $40^{\\circ}$ above the horizon, or $50^{\\circ}$ tilted from the zenith towards the North.",

        "solution": "Each of (a), (b), and (c) are correct. Answer choice (a) is known as the flatness problem. As the universe expands, any deviation from flatness $|\\Omega-1|$ will grow quickly with time, according to the Friedmann equation. Thus, in order to have the flat $(|\\Omega-1|<0.01)$ universe that we observe today, the early universe must have been extremely flat (down to 18 decimal places at $t=1$ second), which is a bizarrely fine-tuned initial condition. Inflation would rapidly flatten the universe, resolving this problem. Answer choice (b) is known as the horizon problem. The Cosmic Microwave Background is observed today to be very uniform in all directions, implying that the universe was in thermal equilibrium at recombination (when CMB radiation was released). However, the conventional Big Bang theory predicts the horizon distance was much smaller than the surface of last scattering (i.e. that light would not have had enough time to travel between opposite points of the CMB), so such a thermal equilibrium should be impossible. Inflation resolves this, since it is possible for the universe to be in thermal equilibrium before inflation. Then, the rapid expansion from inflation would create a universe uniform in temperature regardless of the horizon distance at recombination. Answer choice (c) is the magnetic monopole problem. Grand Unified Theories predict the existence of magnetic monopoles in the very early universe (perhaps 1 in every cubic horizon distance). Not only has no one discovered any magnetic monopoles, the conventional Big Bang theory actually predicts an abundance of magnetic monopoles so large that the density parameter $\\Omega$ would exceed $10^{20}$ ! If the magnetic monopoles formed before inflation, however, the density of magnetic monopoles would drop exponentially, making them impossible to detect today. These three answer choices are the three primary problems of the conventional Big Bang theory, leading to the cosmologists to supplement it with the theory of inflation.",

        "solution": "The Sun's declination varies over the course of the year due to the Earth's axial tilt. At latitude $\\phi$, the Sun will be observed to never set if it has a declination $\\delta$ greater than $90^{\\circ}-\\phi$. Thus, we can calculate the beginning and end of the polar day by calculating when the Sun reaches this declination.\n\nWe draw a spherical triangle with the vernal equinox forming one corner, two sides formed by the celestial equator and the ecliptic, and a third side perpendicular to the celestial equator which represents the declination of the Sun. The lengths of these sides are $\\lambda$ (the ecliptic longitude of the sun), $\\alpha$ and $\\delta$ (the right ascension and declination of the sun) respectively. Using the spherical law of sines on this triangle,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sin \\lambda}{\\sin 90^{\\circ}}=\\frac{\\sin \\delta}{\\sin 60^{\\circ}}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\arcsin \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\sin \\delta\\right)\n$$\n\nFor an observer at $40^{\\circ}$ North, the Sun never sets if $\\delta>50^{\\circ}$, so this period begins and ends when $\\delta=50^{\\circ}$ exactly. Solving for $\\lambda$, we get $\\lambda=62.2^{\\circ}$ or $117.8^{\\circ}$. The Sun never sets when it's between these two points on the ecliptic, which are $55.6^{\\circ}$ apart. Since the Sun traverses a full 360 degrees around the ecliptic in 365 days, this means that the polar day is 56 days long.",

From the previous problem, the latitude of Baia is $90^{\\circ}-\\varepsilon$, so the declination circle of the sun touches the ground at one point. This implies that ground is parallel to a generator of our cone, so the path of Lucas's shadow at this time is a parabola. At the equator, the declination circle intersects the ground in two points, so the path of Justin's shadow is a non-parallel cross section of our cone, i.e., a hyperbola.\n\nNow, consider what happens at the vernal equinox. In both locations, the head of Lucas and Justin coincides with the declination circle, so the \"cone\" has height zero. But then the intersection of the ground with our flat cone is just a line, so both shadows are lines at the vernal equinox.",

        "solution": "If an object is viewed with its orbit edge-on, its radial velocity semi-amplitude $v$ is just its speed along its circular orbit. This problem can be solved by combining Kepler's Third with the knowledge that $m_{s} r_{s}=m_{p} r_{p}$ for two orbiting bodies, but we'll use conservation of momentum instead. Because the two orbiting bodies will always have velocity vectors pointing in opposite directions, in the center of mass frame, $m_{s} v_{s}-m_{p} v_{p}=0$. In addition, because the each body orbits in a circle, we know that $v=2 \\pi R / T$. Using these, we can rewrite Kepler's Third:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\n\\frac{G}{4 \\pi^{2}} M_{S} T^{2}=R_{p}^{3} \\\\\n\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi R_{p}}{T}\\right)^{3} T=M_{S} G \\\\\nv_{p}^{3} \\cdot 4.2 \\text { days }=1.1 M_{\\odot} G \\\\\nv_{p}=1.357 \\cdot 10^{5} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s} .\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nNow, applying conservation of momentum, $m_{p}=m_{s} \\cdot v_{s} / v_{p}=1.1 M_{\\odot} \\cdot \\frac{56 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}}{1.357 \\cdot 10^{5} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}}=$ $0.47 M_{4}$.",

        "solution": "Since the corridor is parallel to the surface of the Earth, we know that the Sun's altitude is 0 degrees. Define points on the celestial sphere as follows: $A$ is David's current location, $B$ is the North Celestial Pole, and $C$ is the location of the Sun.\n\nBy the spherical law of cosines,\n\n$$\n\\cos a=\\cos A \\sin b \\sin c+\\cos b \\cos c\n$$\n\nBy definition, $A$ is the azimuth angle of $245.81^{\\circ}, a=90^{\\circ}-\\delta$ where $\\delta$ is the declination of the Sun, and $c=90^{\\circ}-l$ where $l=42.36^{\\circ}$ is the latitude of Boston. Additionally, $b$ is just 90 degrees minus the altitude of the Sun, so $b=90^{\\circ}$.\n\nTherefore, our equation simplifies to\n\n$$\n\\sin \\delta=\\cos A \\cos l \\Longrightarrow \\delta=\\sin ^{-1}(\\cos A \\cos l)\n$$\n\nCalculating this gives $\\delta=-17.63^{\\circ}$.\n\nNow, we draw a second spherical triangle. Let $A$ be the direction of the vernal equinox, $B$ be the location of the North Celestial Pole, and $C$ be the direction of the Sun.\n\nSince the declination of the Sun is negative but it has been less than 6 months since the last winter solstice, we know that the point $C$ is between the location of the winter solstice and point $A$, and so therefore angle $A=90^{\\circ}+i=113.44^{\\circ}$ where $i=23.44^{\\circ}$ is the Earth's axial\ntilt. Also, we know $a=90^{\\circ}-\\delta$. And since $A$ is on the equator, we must have that $c=90^{\\circ}$. Using the law of cosines again,\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\cos a=\\cos A \\sin b \\sin c+\\cos b \\cos c \\\\\n\\sin \\delta=-\\sin i \\sin b \\Longrightarrow b=\\sin ^{-1}\\left(-\\frac{\\cos A \\cos l}{\\sin i}\\right)=47.64^{\\circ}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nDuring 365.25 days, the Sun travels $360^{\\circ}$ across the celestial sphere, so it would take\n\n$$\n\\frac{47.64^{\\circ}}{360^{\\circ}} \\cdot 365.25 \\text { days }=48.34 \\text { days }\n$$\n\nto reach the vernal equinox from its current position.

        "solution": "Let $N$ denote the north pole, $B$ denote Baia, and $C$ denote Caia. It is well known that the area of $\\triangle N B C$ is equal to its spherical excess multiplied by the squared radius of earth. If $f=[\\triangle N B C] /\\left(4 \\pi R_{\\oplus}^{2}\\right)$, then this implies that\n\n$$\nf=(\\angle N+\\angle B+\\angle C-\\pi) /(4 \\pi) .\n$$\n\nSubstituting $\\angle N=67.55^{\\circ}-18.95^{\\circ}=48.6^{\\circ}=0.848 \\mathrm{rad}$ and $f=0.0675$ gives $\\angle B+\\angle C=\\pi$, so $\\sin \\angle B=\\sin \\angle C$. Applying the spherical law of sines in $\\triangle N B C$, this gives us $\\sin \\left(90^{\\circ}-66.56^{\\circ}\\right)=\\sin N C$. Since $\\angle B$ and $\\angle C$ are supplementary, we thus have $N C=180^{\\circ}-23.44^{\\circ}=156.56^{\\circ}$, so Caia is in the southern hemisphere and $\\delta=66.56^{\\circ} \\mathrm{S}$.\n\nAlternatively, you can also have used the answer choices to help deduce the answer. Given $\\delta=66.56^{\\circ} \\mathrm{S}$, the area of our desired triangle is exactly half of the area of the wedge of earth from $\\lambda=18.95^{\\circ}$ to $\\lambda=67.55^{\\circ}$. Since this wedge covers $48.6^{\\circ} / 360^{\\circ}=13.5 \\%$ of the Earth's surface, $\\triangle N B C$ covers $6.75 \\%$, so $\\delta=66.56^{\\circ}$ is our answer.",

Such a combination of two completely separate branches of astronomical observation begins a new era of 'multi-messenger astronomy'. Since the gravitational waves allow an independent measurement of the distance to the host galaxy and the light allows an independent measurement of the recessional speed, this observation allows us to determine a new, independent value of the Hubble constant $H_{0}$.\n\nAnother way of measuring distances to galaxies is to use the Fundamental Plane (FP) relation, which relies on the assumption there is a fairly tight relation between radius, surface brightness, and velocity dispersion for bulge-dominated galaxies, and is widely used for galaxies like NGC 4993. It can be described by the relation\n\n$$\n\\log \\left(\\frac{D}{(1+z)^{2}}\\right)=-\\log R_{e}+\\alpha \\log \\sigma-\\beta \\log \\left\\langle I_{r}\\right\\rangle_{e}+\\gamma\n$$\n\nwhere $D$ is the distance in Mpc, $R_{e}$ is the effective radius measured in arcseconds, $\\sigma$ is the velocity dispersion in $\\mathrm{km} \\mathrm{s}^{-1},\\left\\langle I_{r}\\right\\rangle_{e}$ is the mean intensity inside the effective radius measured in $L_{\\odot} \\mathrm{pc}^{-2}$, and $\\gamma$ is the distance-dependent zero point of the relation. Calibrating the zero point to the Leo I galaxy group, the constants in the FP relation become $\\alpha=1.24, \\beta=0.82$, and $\\gamma=2.194$.\n\nFigure 2: Left: The GW170817 signal as measured by the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors, taken from Abbott $e t$ al.

        "prompt": "You are participating in an international Astronomy competition and need to solve the following question.\nThe answer to this question is an expression.\nHere is some context information for this question, which might assist you in solving it:\nGW170817 was the first gravitational wave event arising from a binary neutron star merger to have been detected by the LIGO \\& Virgo experiments, and careful localization of the source meant that the electromagnetic counterpart was quickly found in galaxy NGC 4993 (see Figure 2). Such a combination of two completely separate branches of astronomical observation begins a new era of 'multi-messenger astronomy'. Since the gravitational waves allow an independent measurement of the distance to the host galaxy and the light allows an independent measurement of the recessional speed, this observation allows us to determine a new, independent value of the Hubble constant $H_{0}$.\n\nAnother way of measuring distances to galaxies is to use the Fundamental Plane (FP) relation, which relies on the assumption there is a fairly tight relation between radius, surface brightness, and velocity dispersion for bulge-dominated galaxies, and is widely used for galaxies like NGC 4993. It can be described by the relation\n\n$$\n\\log \\left(\\frac{D}{(1+z)^{2}}\\right)=-\\log R_{e}+\\alpha \\log \\sigma-\\beta \\log \\left\\langle I_{r}\\right\\rangle_{e}+\\gamma\n$$\n\nwhere $D$ is the distance in Mpc, $R_{e}$ is the effective radius measured in arcseconds, $\\sigma$ is the velocity dispersion in $\\mathrm{km} \\mathrm{s}^{-1},\\left\\langle I_{r}\\right\\rangle_{e}$ is the mean intensity inside the effective radius measured in $L_{\\odot} \\mathrm{pc}^{-2}$, and $\\gamma$ is the distance-dependent zero point of the relation.

        "prompt": "You are participating in an international Astronomy competition and need to solve the following question.\nThe answer to this question is a numerical value.\nHere is some context information for this question, which might assist you in solving it:\nGW170817 was the first gravitational wave event arising from a binary neutron star merger to have been detected by the LIGO \\& Virgo experiments, and careful localization of the source meant that the electromagnetic counterpart was quickly found in galaxy NGC 4993 (see Figure 2). Such a combination of two completely separate branches of astronomical observation begins a new era of 'multi-messenger astronomy'. Since the gravitational waves allow an independent measurement of the distance to the host galaxy and the light allows an independent measurement of the recessional speed, this observation allows us to determine a new, independent value of the Hubble constant $H_{0}$.\n\nAnother way of measuring distances to galaxies is to use the Fundamental Plane (FP) relation, which relies on the assumption there is a fairly tight relation between radius, surface brightness, and velocity dispersion for bulge-dominated galaxies, and is widely used for galaxies like NGC 4993. It can be described by the relation\n\n$$\n\\log \\left(\\frac{D}{(1+z)^{2}}\\right)=-\\log R_{e}+\\alpha \\log \\sigma-\\beta \\log \\left\\langle I_{r}\\right\\rangle_{e}+\\gamma\n$$\n\nwhere $D$ is the distance in Mpc, $R_{e}$ is the effective radius measured in arcseconds, $\\sigma$ is the velocity dispersion in $\\mathrm{km} \\mathrm{s}^{-1},\\left\\langle I_{r}\\right\\rangle_{e}$ is the mean intensity inside the effective radius measured in $L_{\\odot} \\mathrm{pc}^{-2}$, and $\\gamma$ is the distance-dependent zero point of the relation. Calibrating the zero point to the Leo I galaxy group, the constants in the FP relation become $\\alpha=1.24, \\beta=0.82$, and $\\gamma=2.194$.\n\nFigure 2: Left: The GW170817 signal as measured by the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors, taken from Abbott $e t$ al. (2017). The normalized amplitude (or strain) is in units of $10^{-21}$. The signal is not visible in the Virgo data due to the direction of the source with respect to the detector's antenna pattern.

For two masses, $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, orbiting the centre of mass with separation $a$ with orbital angular velocity $\\omega$, then the dimensionless strain parameter $h$ is\n\n$$\nh \\simeq \\frac{G}{c^{4}} \\frac{1}{r} \\mu a^{2} \\omega^{2}\n$$\n\nwhere $r$ is the luminosity distance, $c$ is the speed of light, $\\mu=m_{1} m_{2} / M_{\\text {tot }}$ is the reduced mass and $M_{\\text {tot }}=m_{1}+m_{2}$ is the total mass.\n\nThe rate of change of frequency of the gravitational waves (called the 'chirp') from a merging binary can be written as\n\n$$\n\\dot{f}_{\\mathrm{GW}}=\\frac{96}{5} \\pi^{8 / 3}\\left(\\frac{G \\mathcal{M}}{c^{3}}\\right)^{5 / 3} f_{\\mathrm{GW}}^{11 / 3}\n$$\n\nproblem:\nf. Using the redshift information from NGC 4993 and the gravitational wave distance you have just calculated, determine the Hubble constant $\\mathrm{H}_{0}$ in units of $\\mathrm{km} \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, along with its absolute uncertainty. Is this value consistent with the one derived by the HST using Cepheid variables (given in part a.)?\n\nAll mathematical formulas and symbols you output should be represented with LaTeX!\nYou can solve it step by step.\nRemember, your answer should be calculated in the unit of \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}, but when concluding your final answer, do not include the unit.\nPlease end your response with: \"The final answer is $\\boxed{ANSWER}$\", where ANSWER is the numerical value without any units.",
