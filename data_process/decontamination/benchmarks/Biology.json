The infection process proceeds until the area of cell lysis becomes so large that it is visible by the naked eye. This area of visible cell lysis, caused initially by one phage, is called a plaque.

        "problem": "Conservation of the critically endangered Maui's dolphin requires a good understanding of the trends in abundance and effective population sizes so that conservation actions can be planned and evaluated. DOC (2012) reported on the genetic monitoring of the Maui's dolphin using DNA profiles to estimate the current abundance and effective population size, as well as to document movements of individuals. The study collected of 37 dart-biopsy samples in summer 2010 and a further 36 in summer 2011. DNA profiles were completed for each sample and the sex was identified. These profiles were used to identify individual Maui's dolphins and Hector's dolphin migrants, to describe individual movements, and to estimate the abundance, population trend and effective population size of Maui's dolphins for 2010-11, including comparison with data from a previous set of samples collected in 2001-07.\n\nBased on the microsatellite genotyping, 26 individuals were identified from the 37 samples collected in 2010 (16 females, 10 males) and 27 individuals from 36 samples collected in 2011 (16 females, 11 males). Twelve individuals were sampled in both 2010 and 2011, and with the addition of one unique male washed up on a beach in 2010, this provided a minimum census of 42 individuals ( 25 females, 17 males) alive at some point during the two years of the survey. Of this total, two females were identified as West Coast South Island Hector's dolphin ( $C$. h. hectori) migrants based on distinct mtDNA haplotypes and genotype-based population assignment procedures.\n\nPopulation size can be estimated by the Lincoln-Petersen estimator:\n\n$N=\\left[\\left(n_{1}+1\\right)\\left(n_{2}+1\\right) /\\left(m_{2}+1\\right)\\right]-1$\n\nWhere $N=$ abundance\n\n$n 1=$ number of individuals sampled in occasion 1\n\n$n 2=$ number of individuals sampled in occasion 2\n\n$m 2=$ number of individuals sampled in both occasions 1 and 2\n\nIndividual movements of Maui's dolphins and a Hector's dolphin migrant $\\left({ }^{\\wedge}\\right)$ that were sampled more than once during 2010-11 are given in Table 2 in the Resource Pack.\n\nAn Expert Panel of New Zealand and international scientists, convened by the New Zealand government in 2012, estimated that five Maui's dolphins were killed in fishing gear each year - one in trawl fisheries and four in gillnet fisheries. The number of gillnet mortalities per year is estimated to have decreased from four to at best two per year as a result of the $350 \\mathrm{sq}$. $\\mathrm{km}$ set net restriction extension in the WCNIMMS. The Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) and the Department of Conservation (DOC) reviewed the Maui's dolphin portion of the Threat Management Plan (TMP) in 2013. During the TMP review process it was highlighted that non-fishing-related threats such as seismic surveying, oil and gas exploration, vessel strikes, and disease also pose a serious risk to the long-term viability of Maui's dolphins. These threats represented $4.5 \\%$ of the estimated dolphin mortalities. The importance of both the fishing and nonfishing risks needs to be assessed relative to the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) level which is defined as the number of human-caused deaths the stock can withstand annually. The PBR for Maui's dolphins is one dolphin in $10-$ 23 years or $0.044-0.1$ per year.\n\nFor Maui's dolphin the impact of seismic surveying was combined within all mining and oil activities.

DOC (2012) reported on the genetic monitoring of the Maui's dolphin using DNA profiles to estimate the current abundance and effective population size, as well as to document movements of individuals. The study collected of 37 dart-biopsy samples in summer 2010 and a further 36 in summer 2011. DNA profiles were completed for each sample and the sex was identified. These profiles were used to identify individual Maui's dolphins and Hector's dolphin migrants, to describe individual movements, and to estimate the abundance, population trend and effective population size of Maui's dolphins for 2010-11, including comparison with data from a previous set of samples collected in 2001-07.\n\nBased on the microsatellite genotyping, 26 individuals were identified from the 37 samples collected in 2010 (16 females, 10 males) and 27 individuals from 36 samples collected in 2011 (16 females, 11 males). Twelve individuals were sampled in both 2010 and 2011, and with the addition of one unique male washed up on a beach in 2010, this provided a minimum census of 42 individuals ( 25 females, 17 males) alive at some point during the two years of the survey. Of this total, two females were identified as West Coast South Island Hector's dolphin ( $C$. h. hectori) migrants based on distinct mtDNA haplotypes and genotype-based population assignment procedures.\n\nPopulation size can be estimated by the Lincoln-Petersen estimator:\n\n$N=\\left[\\left(n_{1}+1\\right)\\left(n_{2}+1\\right) /\\left(m_{2}+1\\right)\\right]-1$\n\nWhere $N=$ abundance\n\n$n 1=$ number of individuals sampled in occasion 1\n\n$n 2=$ number of individuals sampled in occasion 2\n\n$m 2=$ number of individuals sampled in both occasions 1 and 2\n\nIndividual movements of Maui's dolphins and a Hector's dolphin migrant $\\left({ }^{\\wedge}\\right)$ that were sampled more than once during 2010-11 are given in Table 2 in the Resource Pack.\n\nAn Expert Panel of New Zealand and international scientists, convened by the New Zealand government in 2012, estimated that five Maui's dolphins were killed in fishing gear each year - one in trawl fisheries and four in gillnet fisheries. The number of gillnet mortalities per year is estimated to have decreased from four to at best two per year as a result of the $350 \\mathrm{sq}$. $\\mathrm{km}$ set net restriction extension in the WCNIMMS. The Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) and the Department of Conservation (DOC) reviewed the Maui's dolphin portion of the Threat Management Plan (TMP) in 2013. During the TMP review process it was highlighted that non-fishing-related threats such as seismic surveying, oil and gas exploration, vessel strikes, and disease also pose a serious risk to the long-term viability of Maui's dolphins. These threats represented $4.5 \\%$ of the estimated dolphin mortalities. The importance of both the fishing and nonfishing risks needs to be assessed relative to the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) level which is defined as the number of human-caused deaths the stock can withstand annually. The PBR for Maui's dolphins is one dolphin in $10-$ 23 years or $0.044-0.1$ per year.\n\nFor Maui's dolphin the impact of seismic surveying was combined within all mining and oil activities.

        "solution": "A. False. Cytochrome $\\mathrm{c}$ is a slowly evolving protein. Hence, so it is not suitable for establishing evolutionary relationships between closely related species. (The Science of Genetics, Atherly A.G.; Girton J.R.; McDonald J.F. pp. 695).\n\nB. True. Different parts of the same gene evolve at different rates. Those parts of genes that have the least effect on function tend to evolve at highest rates. The idea of the molecular clock is that individual proteins and genes evolve at a constant rate and that the differences in the sequences of present-day organisms can be used to date past evolutionary events. Reference: Genetics a conceptual approach. Pp. 740.\n\nC. True. Short-generation organisms have more rounds of DNA replication per unit of time than long-generation organisms. Hence, the rates of substitution per base per year in short-generation organisms are faster than in organisms with long-generation times.\n\nD. False. The Neutral Theory does not require that all polypeptide and DNA sequences evolve at the same rate. For some positions within a sequence, all or nearly all mutations will be selectively neutral. However, for other positions, a smaller fraction of all mutations will be selectively neutral, and for some positions, almost no mutations will be selectively neutral. Thus, the Neutral Theory explaines the variation in evolutionary rates observed among proteins and DNA regions by invoking differences in functional constraints. The highest rates are observed in molecules or in portions of molecules that are not constrained by selection to preserve a function. The lowest evolutionary rates are observed in molecules where selection pressure is strongest.",

The study collected of 37 dart-biopsy samples in summer 2010 and a further 36 in summer 2011. DNA profiles were completed for each sample and the sex was identified. These profiles were used to identify individual Maui's dolphins and Hector's dolphin migrants, to describe individual movements, and to estimate the abundance, population trend and effective population size of Maui's dolphins for 2010-11, including comparison with data from a previous set of samples collected in 2001-07.\n\nBased on the microsatellite genotyping, 26 individuals were identified from the 37 samples collected in 2010 (16 females, 10 males) and 27 individuals from 36 samples collected in 2011 (16 females, 11 males). Twelve individuals were sampled in both 2010 and 2011, and with the addition of one unique male washed up on a beach in 2010, this provided a minimum census of 42 individuals ( 25 females, 17 males) alive at some point during the two years of the survey.

The study collected of 37 dart-biopsy samples in summer 2010 and a further 36 in summer 2011. DNA profiles were completed for each sample and the sex was identified. These profiles were used to identify individual Maui's dolphins and Hector's dolphin migrants, to describe individual movements, and to estimate the abundance, population trend and effective population size of Maui's dolphins for 2010-11, including comparison with data from a previous set of samples collected in 2001-07.\n\nBased on the microsatellite genotyping, 26 individuals were identified from the 37 samples collected in 2010 (16 females, 10 males) and 27 individuals from 36 samples collected in 2011 (16 females, 11 males). Twelve individuals were sampled in both 2010 and 2011, and with the addition of one unique male washed up on a beach in 2010, this provided a minimum census of 42 individuals ( 25 females, 17 males) alive at some point during the two years of the survey.

All are bright green in colour but with distinguishing coloured areas on the head. The yellow-crowned parakeet is rare but is found throughout forested areas of the North, South and Stewart Islands as well as the sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands. The orange-fronted parakeet is critically endangered with around 300 birds found in just three alpine beech forest valleys in Canterbury. The red-crowned parakeet was widespread throughout the mainland last century but today is very rare on the mainland and only common on islands free of mammalian predators. Forbes' parakeet is restricted to the Chatham Island and also critically endangered. The Antipodes Island parakeet is restricted to the Antipodes Islands.\n\nDeforestation, disease, introduced predators, and shooting by farmers have all contributed to the present restricted distribution of these species. An important conservation tool for the restoration of endangered birds is the translocation of species to habitats that have been restored and introduced predators eradicated.Luis Ortiz-Catedral at the Ecology and Conservation Lab, Institute of Natural \\& Mathematical Sciences, Massey University, has been studying kkriki on Raoul Island, a remote volcanic island approximately $995 \\mathrm{~km}$ north of New Zealand. There had not been a confirmed record of resident parakeets on Raoul Island since 1836 following the introduction of goats, cats and rats. Goats were removed from the island in 1986. Then, in the world's largest multispecies eradication project to date, the New Zealand Department of Conservation (DOC) successfully removed domestic cats, and Norway and Pacific rats (kiore) from Raoul Island using aerial drops of poisoned bait for rats between 2002 and 2004, and follow-up ground-based control for cats.\n\nPrior to the removal of these invasive species on Raoul, the last strongholds for Kermadec red-crowned parakeets were the Herald Islets (ca. 50 breeding pairs) and Macauley (ca. 10,000 breeding pairs) 2-4 km east and $108 \\mathrm{~km}$ south respectively off the coast of Raoul Island. Since 2000 (i.e. two years prior to initiation of the predator removal programme), staff from DOC have carried out bird surveys roughly once a year on Raoul to assess the effect of the removal of predators. No parakeets were detected prior to eradication of cats and rats. After the cat and rat eradication there were infrequent sightings of one to three parakeets. In 2008 during the parakeet survey, 100 parakeets were caught during a 13-day mist-netting period. Of these, 59 were female and 41 were male, of which 56 were adults and 44 sub-adults hatched in 2008 .

        "problem": "Conservation of the critically endangered Maui's dolphin requires a good understanding of the trends in abundance and effective population sizes so that conservation actions can be planned and evaluated. DOC (2012) reported on the genetic monitoring of the Maui's dolphin using DNA profiles to estimate the current abundance and effective population size, as well as to document movements of individuals. The study collected of 37 dart-biopsy samples in summer 2010 and a further 36 in summer 2011. DNA profiles were completed for each sample and the sex was identified. These profiles were used to identify individual Maui's dolphins and Hector's dolphin migrants, to describe individual movements, and to estimate the abundance, population trend and effective population size of Maui's dolphins for 2010-11, including comparison with data from a previous set of samples collected in 2001-07.\n\nBased on the microsatellite genotyping, 26 individuals were identified from the 37 samples collected in 2010 (16 females, 10 males) and 27 individuals from 36 samples collected in 2011 (16 females, 11 males). Twelve individuals were sampled in both 2010 and 2011, and with the addition of one unique male washed up on a beach in 2010, this provided a minimum census of 42 individuals ( 25 females, 17 males) alive at some point during the two years of the survey. Of this total, two females were identified as West Coast South Island Hector's dolphin ( $C$. h. hectori) migrants based on distinct mtDNA haplotypes and genotype-based population assignment procedures.\n\nPopulation size can be estimated by the Lincoln-Petersen estimator:\n\n$N=\\left[\\left(n_{1}+1\\right)\\left(n_{2}+1\\right) /\\left(m_{2}+1\\right)\\right]-1$\n\nWhere $N=$ abundance\n\n$n 1=$ number of individuals sampled in occasion 1\n\n$n 2=$ number of individuals sampled in occasion 2\n\n$m 2=$ number of individuals sampled in both occasions 1 and 2\n\nIndividual movements of Maui's dolphins and a Hector's dolphin migrant $\\left({ }^{\\wedge}\\right)$ that were sampled more than once during 2010-11 are given in Table 2 in the Resource Pack.\n\nAn Expert Panel of New Zealand and international scientists, convened by the New Zealand government in 2012, estimated that five Maui's dolphins were killed in fishing gear each year - one in trawl fisheries and four in gillnet fisheries. The number of gillnet mortalities per year is estimated to have decreased from four to at best two per year as a result of the $350 \\mathrm{sq}$. $\\mathrm{km}$ set net restriction extension in the WCNIMMS. The Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) and the Department of Conservation (DOC) reviewed the Maui's dolphin portion of the Threat Management Plan (TMP) in 2013. During the TMP review process it was highlighted that non-fishing-related threats such as seismic surveying, oil and gas exploration, vessel strikes, and disease also pose a serious risk to the long-term viability of Maui's dolphins. These threats represented $4.5 \\%$ of the estimated dolphin mortalities. The importance of both the fishing and nonfishing risks needs to be assessed relative to the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) level which is defined as the number of human-caused deaths the stock can withstand annually. The PBR for Maui's dolphins is one dolphin in $10-$ 23 years or $0.044-0.1$ per year.\n\nFor Maui's dolphin the impact of seismic surveying was combined within all mining and oil activities.

        "prompt": "You are participating in an international Biology competition and need to solve the following question.\nThis is a multiple choice question (only one correct answer).\nHere is some context information for this question, which might assist you in solving it:\nConservation of the critically endangered Maui's dolphin requires a good understanding of the trends in abundance and effective population sizes so that conservation actions can be planned and evaluated. DOC (2012) reported on the genetic monitoring of the Maui's dolphin using DNA profiles to estimate the current abundance and effective population size, as well as to document movements of individuals. The study collected of 37 dart-biopsy samples in summer 2010 and a further 36 in summer 2011. DNA profiles were completed for each sample and the sex was identified. These profiles were used to identify individual Maui's dolphins and Hector's dolphin migrants, to describe individual movements, and to estimate the abundance, population trend and effective population size of Maui's dolphins for 2010-11, including comparison with data from a previous set of samples collected in 2001-07.\n\nBased on the microsatellite genotyping, 26 individuals were identified from the 37 samples collected in 2010 (16 females, 10 males) and 27 individuals from 36 samples collected in 2011 (16 females, 11 males). Twelve individuals were sampled in both 2010 and 2011, and with the addition of one unique male washed up on a beach in 2010, this provided a minimum census of 42 individuals ( 25 females, 17 males) alive at some point during the two years of the survey. Of this total, two females were identified as West Coast South Island Hector's dolphin ( $C$. h. hectori) migrants based on distinct mtDNA haplotypes and genotype-based population assignment procedures.\n\nPopulation size can be estimated by the Lincoln-Petersen estimator:\n\n$N=\\left[\\left(n_{1}+1\\right)\\left(n_{2}+1\\right) /\\left(m_{2}+1\\right)\\right]-1$\n\nWhere $N=$ abundance\n\n$n 1=$ number of individuals sampled in occasion 1\n\n$n 2=$ number of individuals sampled in occasion 2\n\n$m 2=$ number of individuals sampled in both occasions 1 and 2\n\nIndividual movements of Maui's dolphins and a Hector's dolphin migrant $\\left({ }^{\\wedge}\\right)$ that were sampled more than once during 2010-11 are given in Table 2 in the Resource Pack.\n\nAn Expert Panel of New Zealand and international scientists, convened by the New Zealand government in 2012, estimated that five Maui's dolphins were killed in fishing gear each year - one in trawl fisheries and four in gillnet fisheries. The number of gillnet mortalities per year is estimated to have decreased from four to at best two per year as a result of the $350 \\mathrm{sq}$. $\\mathrm{km}$ set net restriction extension in the WCNIMMS. The Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) and the Department of Conservation (DOC) reviewed the Maui's dolphin portion of the Threat Management Plan (TMP) in 2013. During the TMP review process it was highlighted that non-fishing-related threats such as seismic surveying, oil and gas exploration, vessel strikes, and disease also pose a serious risk to the long-term viability of Maui's dolphins. These threats represented $4.5 \\%$ of the estimated dolphin mortalities. The importance of both the fishing and nonfishing risks needs to be assessed relative to the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) level which is defined as the number of human-caused deaths the stock can withstand annually. The PBR for Maui's dolphins is one dolphin in $10-$ 23 years or $0.044-0.1$ per year.\n\nFor Maui's dolphin the impact of seismic surveying was combined within all mining and oil activities. This was estimated to contribute to the equivalent of 0.10 deaths per year ( $95 \\%$ confidence interval $0.01-0.46$ ), with a $61.3 \\%$ likelihood of exceeding the PBR. In terms of seismic surveying, the greatest concern is noise in the marine environment. Noise leading to trauma was scored at 0.01 deaths per year $(95 \\% \\mathrm{Cl}:<0.01-0.13)$ and a likelihood of exceeding the PBR of $8.8 \\%$, while non-trauma noise effects was scored at 0.03 deaths per year ( $95 \\% \\mathrm{Cl}:<0.01-0.23$ ) and a likelihood of exceeding the PBR of $28.6 \\%$.\n\n(http://www.fish.govt.nz/en-nz/Environmental/Hectors+Dolphins/default.htm)\n\nThe Minister of Conservation has proposed the following measures:\n\n- Making the Code of Conduct for Minimising Acoustic Disturbance to Marine Mammals from Seismic Survey Operations a mandatory standard by reference under section 28 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\n- Developing a voluntary code of conduct with the inshore boat racing community to minimise the potential for vessel strike, and\n- Ensuring that disease investigations are a priority in the Maui's dolphin Research Advisory Group.\n\nThere has been no recommendation to prevent set net and trawl fishing throughout the range of Maui's dolphins as to do so would need to extend fishing restrictions as far south as Whanganui, out to the $100 \\mathrm{~m}$ depth contour, and include all harbours.\n\nproblem:\nConsidering all the scientific evidence you have available about the Maui's dolphin, what would you recommend that the government does to protect this critically endangered dolphin?\n\nA: The extension to the set netting restricted areas together with the new codes of conduct for acoustic surveying and boat racing is sufficient.\nB: Ban set netting and mining and oil activities within the West Coast North Island Marine Mammal Sanctuary.\nC: Ban set netting throughout the range of Maui's dolphins including south to Whanganui, out to the $100 \\mathrm{~m}$ depth contour and within all harbours.\nD: Prevent all mining and oil activities within the West Coast North Island Marine Mammal Sanctuary.\nE: Ban trawl fishing, set netting, and mining and oil activities throughout the range of Maui's dolphins including south to Whanganui, out to the $100 \\mathrm{~m}$ depth contour and within all harbours.\n\nYou can solve it step by step.\nPlease end your response with: \"The final answer is $\\boxed{ANSWER}$\", where ANSWER should be one of the options: [A, B, C, D, E].",

Here, transport against the electrochemical gradient of each ion is called \"active transport\" and transport according to the electrochemical gradient of each ion is called \"passive transport.\"\n\n|  | Soil X | Soil Y | The estimated cytosolic <br> concentrations of each ion in the <br> root epidermal cells |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ | $1 \\mathrm{mM}$ | $0.01 \\mathrm{mM}$ | $100 \\mathrm{mM}$ |\n| $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ | $0.5 \\mathrm{mM}$ | $5 \\mathrm{mM}$ | $5 \\mathrm{mM}$ |\n\nA: In soil X, potassium ions are absorbed by the active transport system.\nB: In soil Y, potassium ions are absorbed by the active transport system.\nC: In soil X, chloride ions are absorbed by the passive transport system. .....\nD: In soil Y, chloride ions are absorbed by the passive transport system. .....\n\nYou can solve it step by step.\nPlease end your response with: \"The final answer is $\\boxed{ANSWER}$\", where ANSWER should be one of the options: [A, B, C, D].",

True.

        "solution": "A. True. At mutation-selection equilibrium frequency of recessive allele can determine by formula $\\mathrm{q}=u / s$, where $\\mathrm{u}=$ mutation rate; $\\mathrm{s}=$ selection coefficient. Because $s=1$ so $q=0.00 .1$\n\nB. False. If selection coefficient of dominant homozygotes is $t$ and selection coefficient of recessive homozygotes is $s$ then frequency of recessive allele at equilibrium, $q=s /(s+t)$. In this case, $s=1, q=0.2$ then $t=0.25$.\n\nC. False. Selection for recessive alleles (selection against dominant phenotypes) is more effective than selection against recessive alleles.\n\nD. False. When selection against recessive homozygotes, frequency of recessive allele in next generation change a value $\\Delta=\\left(-s p q^{2}\\right) /\\left(1-s q^{2}\\right)$. In our case, $s=1$; $q=0.2$ then $\\Delta=0.03333$. Frequency of recessive allele in next generation is $=$ $0.2-0.333=0.1667$.",

        "solution": "STR locus is composed of tandem repeats of several-nucleotide units flanking by two conserved sequences where PCR primers annealing to. Different STR alleles are different in numbers of repeated units, thus different in length. Each STR locus usually has multiple alleles. Combination of several polymorphic STR loci can be used as an individual's DNA fingerprint. With a good combination of STR loci, it is extremely rare for two unrelated people have the same STR record.\n\nBy studying presence of two alleles at each STR locus, it is found that sample 735 is related to Huong and sample 938. Therefore sample 735 cannot be Dat, who is not related to anyone. Statement $\\mathbf{A}$ is False.\n\nSample 669 is related to sample 130 and 264 . There are only two families with three members among analyzed samples. One is Hung, Huong and Dung family and the other is Nhan, Tin and Nghia family. Therefore samples 669, 130 and 264 belong to Nhan, Tin and Nghia. Tin or Nghia each received an allele from Nhan and Nhan must be able to pass different alleles to his two sons. At locus 3, sample 669 has two alleles 4 and 9, sample 130 has 5 and 9, and sample 264 has 1 and 4. Sample 669 possibly pass allele 9 to sample 130 and allele 4 to sample 264. Neither sample 130 nor 264 would be able to pass two different alleles to the other two. Similarly for locus 4, only sample 669 would be able to pass two different alleles to samples 130 and 264 . Therefore, sample 669 is Nhan. Statement $B$ is true.\n\nAs mentioned above, samples 735, sample 938 and Huong are related. Dung is Hung and Huong's son. For each locus, Dung will receive one allele from Huong and the other allele from Hung. Two alleles at each locus of sample 735 can be accounted for by alleles from sample 938 and Huong. While sample 938 cannot receive allele 5 of locus 2, allele 3 of locus 5 from either Huong or sample 735, therefore sample 938 is Hung's and sample 735 is Dung's. Statement C is true.\n\nSamples 297 and 860 are related. However, without a third related person, it is impossible to identify which sample belongs to the father, Phu, or to the son, Quy. Therefore, sample 297 can be either Phu or Quy. Statement D is true.",

        "solution": "A. True. At the level of the organism, this type of colon cancer be inherited in dominant fashion but the mutant tumor-suppressor allele is recessive to the wildtype allele. This is because all somatic cells of the patient carry one recessive defective copy of the gene, the strong likelihood that in at least one of the hundreds of thousands of colon cells heterozygous for the tumor-suppressor gene, a subsequent genetic event will disable the single remaining functional tumorsuppressor allele, resulting in a mutant cell with no functional tumor-suppressor gene. This one cell then multiplies out of control, eventually generating a clone of cancerous cells.\n\nB. True. This can be explained if a wild-type $p 53$ allele is degraded and then resynthesized with template strand by DNA carrying the mutated $p 53$ allele.\n\nC. False. Dominant mutations that change proto-oncogene to oncogene may overactive expression of protein that promotes proliferation. Demethylation cause gene became active so cancer gene in this case is tumor-suppressor gene.\n\nD. True. Inversion can produce a novel oncogene by combining different parts of genes.",

        "solution": "Without any knowledge of exercise physiology, the given table would help the examinees understand that there are multiple energy sources besides stored ATP in our skeletal muscles. Crucial points I wish the students to understand are the differences in the amount and rate of power output depending on the involved metabolic pathways. The questions were prepared to ask examinees about the rationale underlying how the energy source is used during exercise.\n\nA. False: For 100-meter sprinters, their muscles require energy sources with a high output rate to maintain running speed, which is sometimes faster than $10 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. From the data shown in the table, ATP and CP should be the main energy sources needed for such a high rate of power output. CP would be providing additional ATP molecules as the stored $8 \\mathrm{mM}$ ATP inside muscle cells that should be consumed within a few seconds during sprinting. Both are supported by anaerobic process metabolism (without respiration).\n\nB. False: In any kind of sport, the substrate for myosin motors during muscle contractions is ATP alone. I intended for the students to infer that some amount of ATP concentration must never be depleted even if the stored ATP and CP are numerically depleted to be zero. It is quite reasonable to expect that ATP converted from stored fat or glycogen are the main energy sources for long-distance runners.\n\nC. True: For 1,500 $\\mathrm{m}$ athletes who need to run longer than $1 \\mathrm{~min}$, it is clear that stored ATP and CP are not sufficient. I intended for the examinees to infer that ATP supply from both anaerobic (glycolysis) and aerobic (cell respiration) metabolism are crucial, i.e., an intermediate state of energy consumption between sprinters and marathon runners.\n\nD. True: As explained above, ATP enables aerobic metabolism crucial for longdistance runners, thus both stored glycogen and fat should be used during a marathon.",

        "solution": "A. True. If the sensitivity to cortisol is reduced, hypothalamus increases CRH secretion causing the pituitary gland to increase ACTH secretion. This results in increased cortisol secretion. High levels of cortisol cause increasing plasma glucose concentration, which in turn simulates insulin secretion. If the sensitivity of ACTH receptors is reduced, the adrenal glands become smaller leading to decrease in both\nplasma cortisol and glucose concentration. Low level of plasma glucose concentration reduces insulin secretion.\n\nB. False. If sensitivity to thyroxine is increased, hypothalamus reduces TRH secretion causing the pituitary gland to reduce TSH secretion, which in turn reduces thyroxine secretion. Low levels of thyroxine causes both low metabolic rate and low body temperature. If the sensitivity to TRH is increased, the pituitary gland increases TSH secretion, which in turn stimulates thyroxine secretion. High level of thyroxine cause both high metabolic rate and high body temperature.\n\nC. False. Propylthiouracil causes the levels of thyroxine to fall, and this in turn increases TSH secretion. High levels of TSH cause hypertrophy of the thyroid gland. Low levels of thyroxine lead to higher body weight.\n\nD. False. Increased plasma level of CRH tends to increase the size of pituitary gland and ACTH secretion, and this in turn stimulates the adrenal gland to develop. Increased plasma level of TSH tends to increase thyroxine secretion. High level of thyroxine inhibits the secretion of TRH leading to decrease in the size of the pituitary gland, without affecting the adrenal gland.",

The increase in the rate of blood flow to cardiac muscle is higher than that to skin. The rate of blood flow to brain does not change during exercise.\n\nA. True. Part I is cardiac muscle. At rest, the heart works constantly and requires a high amount of ATP that comes mainly from oxidation of fatty acids because fatty acids provide higher energy than glucose. Indeed, about $60 \\%$ of ATP of the cardiac muscle cells comes from oxidation of fatty acid and about $35 \\%$ from oxidation of glucose.\n\nB. False. II is brain. The cells of this part do not use insulin signals to uptake glucose.\n\nC. True. Part III is skin. The increase in blood flow to skin during exercise helps to reduce the body temperature.\n\nD.

DOC (2012) reported on the genetic monitoring of the Maui's dolphin using DNA profiles to estimate the current abundance and effective population size, as well as to document movements of individuals. The study collected of 37 dart-biopsy samples in summer 2010 and a further 36 in summer 2011. DNA profiles were completed for each sample and the sex was identified. These profiles were used to identify individual Maui's dolphins and Hector's dolphin migrants, to describe individual movements, and to estimate the abundance, population trend and effective population size of Maui's dolphins for 2010-11, including comparison with data from a previous set of samples collected in 2001-07.\n\nBased on the microsatellite genotyping, 26 individuals were identified from the 37 samples collected in 2010 (16 females, 10 males) and 27 individuals from 36 samples collected in 2011 (16 females, 11 males). Twelve individuals were sampled in both 2010 and 2011, and with the addition of one unique male washed up on a beach in 2010, this provided a minimum census of 42 individuals ( 25 females, 17 males) alive at some point during the two years of the survey.

        "solution": "A. True. When two plants share the same incompatibility allele, they are unable to produce viable zygotes. Thus, a plant with a new (and therefore, rare) allele has more success at mating, and its allele spreads quickly through the population.\n\nB. True. Once a particular flu virus strain has been common in a human population, most individuals would have developed an immune response to that strain. But a rare, novel strain of the flu virus would be able to spread quickly to almost any individual. This is an example of negative dependent selection.\n\nC. False. This is an example of negative frequency-dependent selection.\n\nD. True. Positive frequency dependent selection gives an advantage to common phenotypes. This means that new alleles can have a difficult time invading a population, since they don't experience significant benefit until they become common. This has been proposed as a difficulty in the evolution of aposematic (or warning) coloration in toxic or distasteful organisms. The presumed advantage of the aposematic coloration is that predators have learned to avoid potential prey with that color pattern. But when the pattern is rare, the predator population does not become 'educated' and the pattern has no benefit. Therefore the warning color is only advantageous once it has become common.",

These profiles were used to identify individual Maui's dolphins and Hector's dolphin migrants, to describe individual movements, and to estimate the abundance, population trend and effective population size of Maui's dolphins for 2010-11, including comparison with data from a previous set of samples collected in 2001-07.\n\nBased on the microsatellite genotyping, 26 individuals were identified from the 37 samples collected in 2010 (16 females, 10 males) and 27 individuals from 36 samples collected in 2011 (16 females, 11 males). Twelve individuals were sampled in both 2010 and 2011, and with the addition of one unique male washed up on a beach in 2010, this provided a minimum census of 42 individuals ( 25 females, 17 males) alive at some point during the two years of the survey.

The sharing behavior of bats is reciprocal altruism, and so the donors have higher chance to receive a donation of blood from other bats in their colony when they are starving, but only when they have been associated for long and know each other.\n\nC. False. Indirect fitness is an individual's fitness plus the additional fitness that it gets by helping genetically related individuals to breed.

        "solution": "A. True. If a particuliar trait found in different taxa of the tree but these taxa do not have most rencent common ancestor then the number of taxa having this trait idicates number of time the trait independently evoleved. For example, the reconstructed phylogeny suggests that self-incomatibility is the ancestral state and that self-compatibility evolved three times within the group of Leptosiphon (see Fig below).\n\n[figure1]\n\nB. True. See the explanation I (A). In addition to using phylogenetic methods to infer evolutionary relationships, biologists can use these techniques to reconstruct the morphology, behavior, or nucleotide and amino acid sequences of ancestral species.\n\nC. False. A molecular clock uses the average rate at which a given gene or protein accumulates changes to gauge the time of divergence for a particular split in the phylogeny. Molecular clocks must be calibrated using independent data such as fossil record, known times of divergence, or biogeographic dates (e.g., the time of separations of continents). Using such calibrations, time of divergence have been estimated for many groups of species that have diverged over millions of years.\n\nD. True. The molecular clock was used to project back to the common ancestor of a group HIV-1 sample. Extrapolation suggests a date of origin for the group of viruses of about 1930.",

        "solution": "A. False. Low value of $\\mathrm{H}^{2}$ indicates that there is a little genetic variance in the population.\n\nB. True. Genetic variance has been changed by shifting the environment and the environmental variance has been changed by a change in genotype. In general, genetic variance depends on the environments to which the population exposed and environmental variance depends on the frequency of the genotypes.\n\nC. False. The artificial selection for a trait with high $\\mathrm{h}^{2}$ (narrow heritability) is more successful than that for a trait with low $\\mathrm{h}^{2}$ but not for $\\mathrm{H}^{2}$.\n\nD. True. The value of the environmental variance can be determined by averaging the variances of parents and the $F_{1}$ because in pure strains and in $F_{1}$ the phenotype variance is considered as the environmental variance. $V_{e}$ $=(1.7+2.1+2.0) / 3=1.9$. The genetic variance $\\left(\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{g}}\\right)$ for the $\\mathrm{F}_{2}$ population is: $4.1-1.9=2.2$. $\\mathrm{H}^{2}=\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{g}} / \\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{p}}=2.2 / 4.1=0.54$.",
