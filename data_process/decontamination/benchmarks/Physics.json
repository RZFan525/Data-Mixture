        "solution": "When a rock is released from a height $h$, the time $t$ it takes to hit the ground is given by $h=\\frac{1}{2} g t^{2}$.\n\nThis means that the acceleration due to gravity is estimated using the equation\n\n$$\ng=\\frac{2 h}{t^{2}}\n$$\n\nSince $t$ is squared in this expression while $h$ appears only in the first power, uncertainty in $t$ has a larger effect on the estimate of $g$ than uncertainty in $h$. More quantitatively, the rules for error propagation are given in the solutions for $F=m a 2018 \\mathrm{~A}$. We will derive the relevant rules explicitly below:\n\nConsider (A), the uncertainty $\\Delta g$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\Delta g=\\left|\\frac{d g}{d h}\\right| \\times \\Delta h\n$$\n\nwhere $d g / d h=2 / t^{2}$ is the derivative of $g$ with respect to $h$. Thus\n\n$$\n\\Delta g=\\frac{2}{t^{2}} \\Delta h\n$$\n\nDividing both sides by $g=2 h / t^{2}$ gives\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta g}{g}=\\frac{\\Delta h}{h}\n$$\n\nSo a $10 \\%$ uncertainty in $h$ implies a $10 \\%$ uncertainty in $g$.\n\nNow look at case (B),\n\n$$\n\\Delta g=\\left|\\frac{d g}{d t}\\right| \\times \\Delta t\n$$\n\nwhere $d g / d t=4 h / t^{3}$ is the derivative of $g$ with respect to $t$. Dividing both sides by $g=2 h / t^{2}$ gives\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta g}{g}=2 \\frac{\\Delta t}{t}\n$$\n\nSo a $10 \\%$ uncertainty in $t$ implies a $20 \\%$ uncertainty in $\\mathrm{g}$.\n\nIf both $\\Delta t$ and $\\Delta h$ are nonzero, then these two independent contributions to the uncertainty add together like the sides of a right triangle:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\Delta g}{g}\\right)^{2}=\\left(\\frac{\\Delta h}{h}\\right)^{2}+\\left(2 \\frac{\\Delta t}{t}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\nInserting $(\\Delta h) / h=(\\Delta t) / t=0.05$ gives $(\\Delta g) / g=0.112$, which means an $11.2 \\%$ uncertainty. So we can conclude that situation (A) produces the smallest uncertainty in $(\\Delta g) / g$.\n\nAlternatively, you can arrive at the same conclusion by exploiting:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\ng=\\frac{2 h}{t^{2}} \\\\\n\\ln g=\\ln 2+\\ln h-2 \\ln t \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} g}{g}=\\frac{\\mathrm{d} h}{h}-2 \\frac{\\mathrm{d} t}{t}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$",

        "solution": "The entropy of an object with constant heat capacity is\n\n$$\nS=\\int \\frac{d Q}{T}=C \\int \\frac{d T}{T}=C \\ln T\n$$\n\nSince the total entropy remains constant, $T_{1} T_{2} T_{3}$ is constant; this is a direct generalization of the result for $T_{f}$ found in part (a). Energy is also conserved, as it makes no sense to leave stored energy unused, so $T_{1}+T_{2}+T_{3}$ is constant.\n\nWhen one object is at temperature $T_{H}$, the other two must be at the same lower temperature $T_{0}$, or else further work could be extracted from their temperature difference, so\n\n$$\nT_{1}+T_{2}+T_{3}=T_{H}+2 T_{0}, \\quad T_{1} T_{2} T_{3}=T_{H} T_{0}^{2}\n$$\n\nPlugging in temperatures with values divided by 100 for convenience, and eliminating $T_{0}$ gives\n\n$$\nT_{H}\\left(7-T_{H}\\right)^{2}=36\n$$\n\nWe know that $T_{H}=1$ is one (spurious) solution, since this is the minimum possible final temperature as found in part (b). The other roots are $T_{H}=4$ and $T_{H}=9$ by the quadratic formula. The solution $T_{H}=9$ is impossible by energy conservation, so\n\n$$\nT_{H}=400 \\mathrm{~K}\n$$\n\nIt is also possible to solve the problem more explicitly. For example, one can run a Carnot cycle between the first two objects until they are at the same temperature, then run a Carnot cycle in reverse between the last two objects using the stored work. At this point, the first two objects will no longer be at the same temperature, so we can repeat the procedure; this yields an infinite series for $T_{H}$. Some students did this, and took only the first term of the series. This yields a fairly good approximation of $T_{H} \\approx 395 \\mathrm{~K}$.\n\nAnother explicit method is to continuously switch between running one Carnot engine forward and another Carnot engine in reverse; this yields three differential equations for $T_{1}, T_{2}$, and $T_{3}$. Solving the equations and setting $T_{1}=T_{2}$ yields $T_{3}=T_{H}$.",

        "solution": "Inductors have a voltage related to change... as driving frequency increases, the inductor reacts more strongly. Hence, the circuit is said to be more inductive. From AC circuit theory, a higher frequency increases the inductive reactance and makes the phase angle more positive. As the reactance increases, the impedance must be increasing as the current decreases, and the current decreases, so does the power associated with the resistor (and hence the source).",

Launched from the center of the cone's base, the minimal speed needed for a projectile to reach the apex (i.e. the highest point of the walls) is $v_{0}$.

        "solution": "If the distance from the base to the apex is $H$, then from energy conservation\n\n$$\ng H=\\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{2}\n$$\n\nLet the shortest distance from the base to the wall be $h$ and the sought minimal speed $v_{1}$ From geometry, $h=H \\sin \\alpha$. Let's consider a new system of coordinates where the two axis $x^{\\prime}$ and $y^{\\prime}$ are parallel and perpendicu lar to the wall respectively. Gravitational ac celeration has components $g_{x^{\\prime}}=g \\cos \\alpha$ and $g_{y^{\\prime}}=g \\sin \\alpha$. It is clear that the motion along the $x^{\\prime}$ axis doesn't affect whether the projectile hits the wall. Because the motions in the $x^{\\prime}$ and $y^{\\prime}$ direction are independent, one has to set the component of $\\vec{v}_{1}$ parallel to $x^{\\prime}$ to 0 in order to minimize the total speed.\n\nThen the problem reduces to hitting a projectile into a conventional ceiling of height $h$ in effective gravity $g \\sin \\alpha$.

        "solution": "The most important physics to consider is that the magnetic flux through the superconducting mesh is effectively locally locked in place. Consider this effect before anything else. Once the mesh is cooled to the superconducting state the magnetic field as a function of position on the mesh cannot be varied, regardless of the change in location of the dipole. Since the magnetic field is effectively specified along this superconducting plane, the problem reduces to a boundary value problem that is traditionally solved by the method of images.\n\nFirst, consider what happens if the physical dipole is moved far away from the mesh. An image dipole must be located that fixes the magnetic field to be unchanged. This can be done with an image dipole that is located a distance $a$ behind the mesh, and it must have the same orientation $m$. Now bring back the original dipole, placing it a distance $b$. It is necessary to cancel out the field from this original, but now displaced, dipole with an opposite dipole $-m$ placed behind the mesh at a distance $b$.\n\nDouble check your work. If the original dipole is placed at the original location $a$, then there is no need for image charges, and they should cancel out. Indeed, the two image dipoles will, as they have opposite orientations.\n\nThe force between the dipole and the image charges must be determined. Though it might be possible to write down these answers quickly, the derivation is shown below.\n\nConsider first that a magnetic dipole moment $m$ can be thought of as a pair of magnetic monopoles of strength $q_{m}$ and $-q_{m}$ separated by a distance $d$ such that $m=q_{m} d$. Determine the magnetic field strength a distance $x \\gg d$ away from the dipole:\n\n$$\nB=\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4 \\pi} \\frac{q_{m}}{x^{2}}+\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4 \\pi} \\frac{\\left(-q_{m}\\right)}{(x+d)^{2}}\n$$\n\nIt should be clear that $q_{m}$ is at the origin and $-q_{m}$ is a distance $d$ farther away from the reference point $x$ where the field $B$ is being determined. This expression is exact.\n\nThe second term can be subjected to a binomial expansion and then:\n\n$$\nB \\approx \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4 \\pi} \\frac{q_{m}}{x^{2}}-\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4 \\pi} \\frac{q_{m}}{x^{2}}\\left(1-2 \\frac{d}{x}\\right)=\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{2 \\pi} \\frac{q_{m} d}{x^{3}}=\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{2 \\pi} \\frac{m}{x^{3}}\n$$\n\nNow consider the magnetic force on a dipole at the location $x$ in a non-uniform field $B$, which is given by:\n\n$$\nF=-q_{m} B(x)+q_{m} B(x+d)\n$$\n\nwhich can be approximated by a Taylor expansion of $B$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& F \\approx-q_{m} B(x)+q_{m}\\left(B(x)+\\left.d \\frac{d B}{d x}\\right|_{x}\\right) \\\\\n& F=q_{m} d\\left(-\\frac{3 \\mu_{0}}{2 \\pi} \\frac{m}{x^{4}}\\right)=-\\frac{3 \\mu_{0}}{2 \\pi} \\frac{m^{2}}{x^{4}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe negative sign means that two parallel identical dipoles separated by a distance $x$ will attract.\n\nReturning to the problem, the physical dipole at $b$ will be attracted to the image dipole at location $-a$ and repelled from the image dipole at $-b$, so:\n\n$$\n-\\frac{3 \\mu_{0}}{2 \\pi} \\frac{m^{2}}{(b+a)^{4}}+\\frac{3 \\mu_{0}}{2 \\pi} \\frac{m^{2}}{(b+b)^{4}}=\\frac{3 \\mu_{0} m^{2}}{2 \\pi}\\left(\\frac{1}{16 b^{4}}-\\frac{1}{(a+b)^{4}}\\right),\n$$\n\nwhere a negative sign means that the physical dipole feels attraction toward the mesh.\n\nIt is entertaining to consider what happens if $b$ is almost the same as $a$, say $b=a+\\delta$. In this case,\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{3 \\mu_{0} m^{2}}{2 \\pi}\\left(\\frac{1}{16(a+\\delta)^{4}}-\\frac{1}{(2 a+\\delta)^{4}}\\right)\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\nF \\approx \\frac{3 \\mu_{0} m^{2}}{2 \\pi} \\frac{1}{16 a^{4}}\\left(\\left(1-4 \\frac{\\delta}{a}\\right)-\\left(1-4 \\frac{\\delta / 2}{a}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich simplifies further into:\n\n$$\nF \\approx-\\frac{3 \\mu_{0} m^{2}}{16 \\pi a^{5}} \\delta\n$$",

One way to do it, is to notice that when we disconnect \"blue\" and \"black\" we can get a small spark, or feel a small pulse of current if we happen to touch the wires at that point. That is because $L \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial t}=U_{l}$ - the current through the inductor can't change instantaneously and the voltage will generated by the inductor enough for spark or high voltage pulse. Meanwhile if we have capacitor in parallel with inductor while disconnecting the circuit we wont get the effect. By testing with \"white\" lead parallel with \"black\" or with \"blue\" we can determine that no spark happens in latter case and the circuit in the black box is circuit $B$ from the figure.\nv)\n\nBy connecting voltmeter between \"white\" and \"black\" or \"white\" and \"blue\" we can see the voltage decaying exponentially. That means indeed, that the capacitor is connected to the white\" wire and depending if the other lead is connected to \"black\" or \"blue\" we are charging the capacitor to negative battery voltage through voltmeter or discharging it through voltmeter and inductor and diode. We have to be careful not to touch both wires at the same time, since the resistance of good skin conductance is much smaller then the resistance of the voltmeter.\n\nWe can measure the capacitance by measuring the exponent: for example by taking two voltage readings and measuring the time interval between the readings. $C=\\frac{\\ln \\frac{U_{1}}{U_{2}}}{\\tau R_{m}} \\approx 1 \\mathrm{uF}$.",

We connect voltmeter between \"white\" and \"black\", so that we measure the total of the capacitor and battery voltage. The reading is zero at the start since all black box leads are connected. Now we disconnect the\ninductor battery current loop by disconnecting has reached zero.\n\n\"black\" from other box leads and the multimeter reading will jump to $U_{c}+U$ approx $32 \\mathrm{~V}$ and starts to decay exponentially as before. We can do this many times to get a maximum reading.\n\nAfter disconnecting the \"black\", the current goes through LCR circuit formed by inductor and capacitor, but instead of oscillating it stop due to the diode when current through inductor\nWe can get the upper and lower bounds for the inductance value by considering two different cases.\n\nUpper bound we can get when we neglect the resistive losses. In that case all the energy at the end is in the capacitor. When we write down the energy balance we get:\n\n$$\n\\frac{U^{2} C}{2}+\\frac{I^{2} L}{2}=\\frac{U_{c}^{2} C}{2} \\Rightarrow L \\approx 130 \\mathrm{mH}\n$$\n\nLower bound we can get when we assume that most of the energy went to resistive losses, in that case the inductor current decays exponentially and we can write expression for the down the total charge:\n\n$$\n\\left(U_{c}+U\\right) * C=I \\frac{R_{l}}{L} \\Rightarrow L \\approx 33.6 \\mathrm{mH}\n$$\n\nThe correct value for the inductor $L \\approx$ $100 \\mathrm{mH}$ is between those bounds and closer to the upper bound as we may guess since $U_{c}>U$.",

Gossard (here we neglect the thickness of the two-dimensional electron layer). A strong uniform magnetic field $B$ was applied perpendicular to the two-dimensional electron system. As illustrated in Figure 1, when a current $I$ was passing through the sample, the voltage $V_{\\mathrm{H}}$ across the current path exhibited an unexpected quantized plateau (corresponding to a Hall resistance $R_{\\mathrm{H}}=$ $3 h / e^{2}$ ) at sufficiently low temperatures.

        ],
        "solution": "Because the expansion of water is reversible, entropy is conserved. This means that the change in entropy due to the expansion of the vapour is balanced by the entropy change due to condensation. As discussed before, because entropy is a function of state, it's most convenient to calculate the entropy change by imagining $n$ moles of water ( $n$ will later cancel out) cooling and expanding from $T_{t}, p_{t}$ to $T_{0}, p_{0}$ and condensing $r n$ moles of water at the end. $r$ is found by demanding that $\\Delta S=0$ in this process.\n\nThe entropy change of the vapour is found by applying the first law of thermody namics over a small temperature and pres sure increment $\\mathrm{d} T, \\mathrm{~d} p$ :\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{d} S_{\\text {vapour }}=\\frac{\\mathrm{d} Q}{T}=\\frac{\\mathrm{d} U+\\mathrm{d} W}{T}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{d} U=n c_{v} \\mathrm{~d} T$ is the change in internal energy of the vapour and $\\mathrm{d} W=p \\mathrm{~d} V$ is the work done by the vapour. Importantly, we neglect the volume of water compared to the vapour, as that allows using the ideal gas to simplify the work differential. Using the ideal gas law, we then have\n\n$$\np \\mathrm{~d} V=p \\mathrm{~d}\\left(\\frac{n R T}{p}\\right)=n R \\mathrm{~d} T-n R T \\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{p} .\n$$\n\nHence,\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{d} S_{\\text {vapour }}=n\\left(c_{v}+R\\right) \\frac{\\mathrm{d} T}{T}-n R \\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{p}\n$$\n\nand we can integrate to get\n\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\text {vapour }}=n c_{p} \\ln \\left(\\frac{T_{0}}{T_{1}}\\right)-n R \\ln \\left(\\frac{p_{0}}{p_{1}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $c_{p}=c_{v}+R=R(i+2) / 2=R \\gamma /(\\gamma-1)$ is the heat capacity at constant pressure. The net change in entropy is then\n\n$\\Delta S_{\\text {tot }}=0=\\Delta S_{\\text {vapour }}+\\Delta S_{\\text {conden }}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =\\Delta S_{\\text {vapour }}-r n \\frac{M L}{T_{0}} \\\\\n& =n c_{p} \\ln \\left(\\frac{T_{0}}{T_{1}}\\right)-n R \\ln \\left(\\frac{p_{0}}{p_{1}}\\right)-r n \\frac{M L}{T_{0}} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$r=\\frac{R T_{0}}{M L}\\left(\\ln \\left(\\frac{p_{1}}{p_{0}}\\right)-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1} \\ln \\left(\\frac{T_{1}}{T_{0}}\\right)\\right)=0.114$.\n\nTo find the mass flow rate, we start by finding the flow speed $v$ of the outgoing liquid/vapour. Since we know $r$, we can ap ply energy conservation (necessary for the reversibility to hold) on a flowing water packet This is most conveniently done by demand ing energy conservation on the system as a whole. Suppose that in some time interval $n$ moles of water vapour with a volume of $V_{t}$ are created at the boiler. Then at the outlet, in the steady state, due to conservation of particles, $(1-r) n$ moles of water vapour at a volume of $V_{0}$, alongside $r n$ moles of li quid water, are removed. The outflowing water has an additional kinetic energy of $n \\mu v^{2} / 2$. The energy change of the whole system due to both steps must cancel each-other out due to energy conservation. We can write this as\n\n$$\n0=W_{\\text {in }}-W_{\\text {out }}+U_{\\text {in }}-U_{\\text {out }}-n M v^{2} / 2=0\n$$\n\nwhere $W_{\\text {in }}=p_{t} V_{t}=n R T_{t}$ and $W_{\\text {out }}=p_{0} V_{0}=$ $(1-r) n R T_{0}$ are the works done by the in coming and outgoing packet and similarly, $U_{\\text {in }}=c_{v} n T_{t}$ and $U_{\\text {out }}=c_{v} n T_{0}-r n M L+r n R T_{0}$ are the internal energies of the incoming and outgoing packet. Notice that for the outgoing internal energy, we have an extra term of $r p_{0} V_{0}=r n R T_{0}$. This is because when talk ing about the latent heat of vaporisation, it in cludes the work done in order to expand th vapour into the volume it's supposed to oc cupy. Therefore, we should subtract the said work from the latent heat of vaporisation, in order for it to capture the actual change in the internal energy of the water. Combining everything, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n0 & =n R T_{t}-(1-r) n R T_{0}+c_{v} n T_{t} \\\\\n& -c_{v} n T_{0}+r n M L-r n R T_{0}-n M v^{2} / 2 \\\\\n& =\\left(c_{v}+R\\right) n\\left(T_{t}-T_{0}\\right)+r n M L-n M v^{2} / 2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\nv=\\sqrt{2\\left(\\frac{c_{p} \\Delta T}{M}+r L\\right)}=906 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}\n$$\n\nThe density of air at the outlet is found from ideal gas law $\\rho=p_{0} M /\\left(R T_{0}\\right)$. The mass flow rate of water vapour is then\n\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{vapour}}=A \\rho v=\\frac{A p_{0} M v}{R T_{0}}\n$$\n\nbut we also have liquid water flowing out such that the total flow rate is given by\n\n$$\n\\mu=\\frac{1}{1-r} \\mu_{\\text {vapour }}=\\frac{A p_{0} M v}{(1-r) R T_{0}}=59 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{s} .\n$$",

        ],
        "solution": "Since $L_{\\odot}$ and $m$ are constant, we need to minimise the quantity $T J$. Note that the minimal angular momentum corresponds to the case when the satellite is launched directly opposite to the motion of Earth. It turns out that this also corresponds to the minimal orbital period. Let $\\vec{v}_{2}$ be the satellite's velocity in Sun's frame. Then $\\vec{v}_{2}=$ $\\vec{v}_{1}-\\vec{v}_{\\oplus}$, where $v_{\\oplus}=\\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{\\odot}}{R_{\\oplus}}}$ is Earth's velocity. For convenience, let's write $x=\\frac{v_{2}}{v_{\\oplus}}$. Consider the total energy of an elliptical orbit $E_{\\text {tot }}=-\\frac{G M_{\\odot} m}{2 a}$. On the other hand, the total energy is $E_{\\text {tot }}=\\frac{m v_{2}^{2}}{2}-\\frac{G M_{\\odot} m}{R_{\\oplus}}$. combining the two equations and rearranging, $\\frac{R_{\\oplus}}{a}=$ $2-\\frac{v_{2}^{2} R_{\\oplus}}{G M_{\\oplus}}=2-x^{2}$. From Kepler's III Law, $\\frac{T^{2}}{a^{3}}=\\frac{4 \\pi^{2}}{G M_{\\odot}}$. Thus, $T=\\frac{2 \\pi R_{\\oplus}^{3}}{\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot}}}\\left(2-x^{2}\\right)^{-3 / 2}$ As we can see, in order to minimise $T, v_{2}$ needs to be minimal as well.\n\nIn conclusion, $I_{\\text {avg }}$ is maximal when the satellite is launched directly against the motion of Earth. The corresponding value for $I_{\\text {avg }}$ is\n\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{avg}}=\\frac{L_{\\odot}}{4 \\pi R_{\\oplus}^{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{\\odot}}{R_{\\oplus}}} \\frac{1}{v_{2}}\\left(2-x^{2}\\right)^{3 / 2}=\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{L_{\\odot}}{4 \\pi R_{\\oplus}^{2}} \\frac{\\left(2-x^{2}\\right)^{3 / 2}}{x}\n$$\n\nwhere $x=\\sqrt{\\frac{R_{\\oplus}}{G M_{\\odot}}} \\sqrt{v_{0}^{2}-2 g r_{\\oplus}}-1$.",

        "solution": "In the case of a plasma ball, both the electrons and protons are free to move around. Both electrons and protons can be treated as exerting equal pressure. This effectively doubles the average energy of one molecule from $\\frac{3}{2} k T$ to $3 k T$ while keeping the gravitational energy expression the same. Therefore $U=-3 \\int V \\mathrm{~d} p=-E_{G}$ so the new proportionality factor between the thermal energy and gravitational energy is $\\beta=1$.",

        "solution": "Let the ball $A$ be given an initial velocity $v$ along the axis $Y$, which is perpendicular to the $\\operatorname{rod}$. The total momentum of the system conserves, therefore the center-of-mass (CM) of the system moves with a constant velocity:\n\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{CM}}=\\frac{m v}{3 m}=\\frac{v}{3}\n$$\n\nalong $Y$. In what follows, we will work in the CM frame of reference, which is an inertial system of reference. Therefore, in the CM frame the laws of conservation of energy, momentum, and the angular momentum hold true. The initial velocities of the three balls along $Y$ are:\n\n$$\nv_{A}=\\frac{2 v}{3} ; v_{B}=v_{C}=-\\frac{v}{3}\n$$\n\nCorrespondingly, the total kinetic energy of the balls is:\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{m v^{2}}{2}\\left(\\frac{4}{9}+\\frac{1}{9}+\\frac{1}{9}\\right)=\\frac{m v^{2}}{3}\n$$\n\nand the total angular momentum with respect to the CM equals:\n\n$$\nL=m \\frac{2 v}{3} \\ell-m \\frac{v}{3}(-\\ell)=m v \\ell\n$$\n\nIn any moment the three balls form an isosceles triangle with an angle $2 \\varphi$ at the top vertex. The distance between $A$ and $C$ is minimal when either $\\varphi=0$, or $\\dot{\\varphi}=0$. For $\\varphi=0$, however, the laws of conservation are not consistent with the rigidity of the rods. Therefore, at the minimal distance $\\dot{\\varphi}=0$, and in this particular instance the system behaves as a rigid body whose moment of inertia with respect to the CM can be obtained through:\n\n$$\nI=\\frac{L^{2}}{2 E}=\\frac{3}{2} m \\ell^{2}\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, the moment of inertia $I$ could be found independently from geometric considerations. Although, $I$ could be found using the distances from the balls to the CM (medicentre of a triangle), it is more convenient to use this relatively unknown formula for the moment of inertia of a collection of point masses with respect to CM:\n\n$$\nI=\\frac{\\sum_{i, j} m_{i} m_{j}\\left(\\boldsymbol{r}_{i}-\\boldsymbol{r}_{j}\\right)^{2}}{\\sum_{i} m_{i}}\n$$\n\nIn our case:\n\n$$\nI=\\frac{m^{2}}{3 m}\\left(A B^{2}+B C^{2}+A C^{2}\\right)=\\frac{m}{3}\\left(2 \\ell^{2}+d^{2}\\right) .\n$$\n\nFrom (1) and (2), we obtain the minimal distance:\n\n$$\nd=\\ell \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}} \\approx 1.58 \\ell\n$$",

Consider Fred's frame at time $t=0$. In this frame, the alien is also stationary. The light takes a time $h / c$ to reach the alien; at this point the alien has picked up a velocity of $g h / c$. Then using the ordinary Doppler shift formula gives a frequency shift of $1+g h / c^{2}$ as seen above. This is valid, as all the effects we implicitly ignored were higher order in $g$, but it harder to see this.",

        "solution": "Denote by $O$ the focus of the elliptical orbit of the comet where the Sun is, and by $Q$ the other focus of the comet's orbit. Let $B$ and $C$ be the intersection points of the Earth's and the comet's orbits.\n\n[figure1]\n\nWe will show that the points $B, C$ and $O$ are all approximately on the same line by proving that the angle $\\angle Q O B$ is approximately $90^{\\circ}$. By the property of the ellipse that the sum of the lengths of the line segments drawn from any point on the ellipse to the two focal points is constant we get\n\n$$\n|Q B|+|B O|=|Q P|+|O P|=|Q O|+2|O P| \\text {. }\n$$\n\nBy using $|B O|=R_{0}$ and that approximately $|O P|=\\frac{1}{2} R_{0}$ (the equality is in the limit that $R_{\\max }$ goes to infinity), we get that $|Q B|=$ $Q O \\mid$. So the triangle $\\triangle Q B O$ is isosceles and the angles $\\angle Q O B$ and $\\angle Q B O$ are equal. Because $|Q B| \\gg|O B|$, we have approximately $\\angle Q O B=$ $\\angle Q B O=90^{\\circ}$ and all the points $B, C$ and $O$ are approximately on the same line.\n\nThe radius vector of the comet covers an area $S_{B C P}$ contained between the segment $B C P$ of the ellipse and the straight line $B C$. We will approximate this segment of the ellipse as a parabola. The surface area of a mirror-symmetric parabolic segment is equal to two thirds of the product of its height and length, as can be de-\ntermined by integrating the parabola:\n\n$$\nS_{B C P}=\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 2 R_{0} \\cdot \\frac{R_{0}}{2}=\\frac{2}{3} R_{0}^{2} .\n$$\n\n$90^{\\circ}$. So in the right angled triangle $\\triangle B O Q$ we have\n\n$$\n\\cos \\angle B O Q=\\frac{|O B|}{|O Q|}=\\frac{R_{0}}{R_{\\text {max }}-\\frac{R_{0}}{2}} \\approx 0,\n$$\n\nBy Kepler's second law the comet sweeps out equal areas in equal times (i.e. the time required to cover some segment of the ellipse is propor tional to the area of the segment drawn out by the radius vector connecting the comet and the Sun). Since $v_{t}=w$, the radius vector of the comet covers the surface area at the same rate as the radius vector of the Earth, which is $\\pi R_{0}^{2} / T$ where $T$ is one year. Therefore\n\n$$\nt=\\frac{S_{B C P}}{\\pi R_{0}^{2}} T=\\frac{2}{3 \\pi} 365 \\text { days } \\approx 77 \\text { days. }\n$$\n\nAlternative solution: We can also prove that the intersection points of the orbits and the sun lie on the same line in the following way. Near the Sun we can approximate the orbit as a parabola. Due to the geometrical property of a parabola, if we take the $x$-axis parallel to be the axis of the parabola pointing towards the perihelion $P$, and the origin $O$ at the focus (i.e. the Sun) then for any point $S$ at the parabola, $|O S|+x=$ $2|O P|=R_{0}$, where $x$ is the $x$-coordinate of $S$. For the intersection points $B$ and $C$ of the Earth's and comet's orbits. $|O B|=|O C|=R_{0}$ therefore for the both points $x=0$, i.e. $O, A$ and $B$ all lie on the $y$-axis.\n\nAlternative solution: Here is an alternative solution to show that the points $B, C$ and $O$ are all approximately on the same line. We have\n\n$$\n|O Q|=R_{\\text {max }}-R_{\\text {min }}=R_{\\text {max }}-\\frac{R_{0}}{2}\n$$\n\nEvery ellipse has the property that the lines drawn from any point on the ellipse to the two focal points are at the same angle to the tangent. Using this property, because the tangent at point $B$ is at $45^{\\circ}$ to the segment $O B$, then $|B Q|$ is also at $45^{\\circ}$ to the tangent and $\\angle O B Q=$ where we used the fact that $R_{\\max } \\gg R_{0}$. So we have approximately $\\angle B O Q=90^{\\circ}$ and the points $B, C$ and $O$ all lie on the same line.",

        "solution": "The main effect is that the ice radiates heat into the air due to the temperature gradient through it, and this freezes the water next to the ice. However, there are many other effects that slightly change the answer.\n\ni. There is another contribution to the thermal power from the temperature gradient in the water.\n\nii. As the water freezes, it lifts the ice above it.\n\niii. When a layer of water freezes into ice, all of the other water and ice becomes slightly colder.\n\nThe first point should be addressed for full credit. To do this, we will calculate both contributions. The water right at the bottom of the ice is at $0 \\mathrm{C}^{\\circ}$. The temperature gradients in the water and ice are both uniform since the system is in quasi-equilibrium; physically, if the temperature gradient were not uniform, there would be a net flow of heat to or away from some regions, quickly making the gradient uniform again.\n\nThe temperature gradient in the water is $4 \\mathrm{C}^{\\circ} / 5 \\mathrm{~m}$. Multiplying by the conductivity, we get a power of\n\n$$\nP_{w}=\\frac{4 \\mathrm{C}^{\\circ}}{5 \\mathrm{~m}} \\frac{0.57 \\mathrm{~W}}{\\mathrm{mC}^{\\circ}}=0.456 \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{m}^{2}\n$$\n\ndelivered through the water. The same calculation for the ice gives power\n\n$$\nP_{i}=\\frac{10 \\mathrm{C}^{\\circ}}{.01 \\mathrm{~m}} \\frac{2.2 \\mathrm{~W}}{\\mathrm{~m} \\cdot \\mathrm{C}^{\\circ}}=2200 \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{m}^{2}\n$$\n\ndelivered through the ice. Thus $P_{w}$ is negligible and can be ignored.\n\nNow, each square meter of water directly underneath the ice loses $2200 \\mathrm{~J}$ of energy per second. That is enough energy to freeze\n\n$$\n2200 \\mathrm{~W} /(330,000 \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{kg})=6.7 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nof water into ice. Converting to volume, we have\n\n$$\n\\left(6.7 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{s}\\right) /\\left(920 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}\\right)=7.2 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~m}^{3} / \\mathrm{s}\n$$\n\nof ice formed for each square meter of ice, which means the ice is growing at a rate\n\n$$\nr=7.2 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}=2.6 \\mathrm{~cm} / \\mathrm{hr}\n$$\n\nNext, we will account for the second and third points; these are not necessary for full credit. First consider the rising of the water. Each square meter of ice initially weighs $9.2 \\mathrm{~kg}$. A power of $2200 \\mathrm{~W}$ is enough to lift this ice about $24 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$ against gravity. In reality, the ice is lifted at a much slower rate, so this accounts for a negligible portion of the energy.\n\nThe third point requires some more explanation. In an appropriate coordinate system, the temperature profile of the ice is\n\n$$\nT(x, d)=\\left(1-\\frac{x}{d}\\right) \\delta T, \\quad x \\in[0, d]\n$$\n\nwhere $d$ is the thickness and $\\delta T=-10 \\mathrm{C}^{\\circ}$. As the thickness $d$ increases, all of the ice must decrease slightly in temperature to maintain a linear temperature gradient,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial d}=\\frac{x}{d^{2}} \\delta T\n$$\n\nBy drawing a graph, one can see this contribution is equal to the heat that would be needed to cool the new ice formed by $5 \\mathrm{C}^{\\circ}$, which gives a $3 \\%$ correction to the answer. There is also a similar contribution from cooling the water, which is negligible. Finally, we neglected the sublimation of the ice.",

The on-board fuel (antimatter) is annihilated with an equal mass of matter to create photons yielding a reactive force.

        "solution": "The final speed is easiest to find by applying energy and momentum (4momentum) conservation in the initial and final configurations. If the final rest mass of the ship is $m_{f}$, then $M-m_{f}$ of antimatter is burnt throughout the acceleration and an equal amount of matter is burnt from the interstellar space. Hence, it makes sense to onsider the system of the ship + the burnt interstellar gas.\n\nThe initial rest mass of the system is $M+$ $\\left(M-m_{f}\\right)=2 M-m_{f}=M_{i}$. This corresponds to an energy of $\\boldsymbol{E}_{i}=\\boldsymbol{M}_{i} c^{2}$ and momentum $p_{i}=0$ due to the gas and the ship initially being at rest.\n\nIn the final configuration, we have the space ship moving with a speed of $v$ with energy $\\boldsymbol{E}_{f}$ and momentum $\\boldsymbol{p}_{f}$. We also have a photon cloud with energy $E_{p}$ and momentum $p_{p}$, moving opposite to the direction of the space ship. Then the energy and momentum conservation simply read as $E_{f}+E_{p}=E_{i}$ and $p_{i}=0=p_{f}+p_{p}$. We also have the 4-momentum invariant for both the space ship and the photon gas. They read $E_{f}^{2}-p_{f}^{2} c^{2}=m_{f}^{2} c^{4}$ and $E_{p}^{2}-p_{p}^{2} c^{2}=0$. Solving the 4 equations (with 4 unknowns), we get\n\n$$\np_{f}=\\frac{M_{i}^{2}-m_{f}^{2}}{2 M_{i}} c, \\quad E_{f}=\\frac{M_{i}^{2}+m_{f}^{2}}{2 M_{i}} c\n$$\n\nWe could find the velocity by solving for $v$ in the expression for the relativistic energy $E_{f}=m_{f} \\gamma_{f} c^{2}$ with $\\gamma_{f}=\\left(1-v_{f}^{2} / c^{2}\\right)^{-0.5}$. A faster way, however, would be to use the expression for final momentum, $p_{f}=m_{f} \\gamma_{f} v$, and notice that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nv_{f} & =\\frac{p_{f}}{E_{f}} c^{2}=\\frac{M_{i}^{2}-m_{f}^{2}}{M_{i}^{2}+m_{f}^{2}} c \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\left(2 M-m_{f}\\right)^{2}-m_{f}^{2}}{\\left(2 M-m_{f}\\right)^{2}+m_{f}^{2}} c \\\\\n& =\\frac{180}{181} c \\approx 0.9945 c .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$",

As such, part of the rotational energy of the plate is transferred over to the escaping air molecules. Further, the pressure and temperature of the gas is uniform, because of the incompressibility condition.\n\nSince the problem is 2-dimensional, the mass, volumes, moment of inertia and other quantities are per unit length of the system (on the figure, into the page). Let $x$ mark the distance from the bump and $v$ denote the horizontal speed of air at $x$. There is a volume of air equal to $V(x)=x h x /(2 L)$ between $x=0$ and $x$. As the plate falls down, $V(x)$ gets smaller and as a result, air is pushed out. Consider a small time interval $\\mathrm{d} t$.

        "solution": "The drone stays afloat by using the motor to push air through its propellers. The amount of thrust is clearly a function of the density of the air and the speed $v$ at which air goes through the propellers.\n\nForce balance can be written down as $\\boldsymbol{F}$ $m_{\\text {tot }} g=0$, where $F$ is the vertical thrust and $m_{\\text {tot }}$ the total mass of the drone. If $A$ is the effective area of the propellers, it's possible to write down the expression for $\\boldsymbol{F}$ by either using the dynamical pressure $\\rho v^{2}$ or by considering the conservation of momentum. In a time interval $\\Delta t$, a volume of $\\Delta V=A v \\Delta t$ of air passes through the propellers. The air volume carries momentum $\\Delta p=\\Delta V \\rho v$, so the thrust is given by $F=\\Delta p / \\Delta t=A \\rho v^{2}$.\n\nSecondly, it's possible to tie the power output $P$ of the motor with outside air density and speed. Notably, the air is pushing the propellers vertically up with a force $\\boldsymbol{F}$. In order to function, the propeller blades need to be slanted. This amounts to a torque that's proportional to $F$. Further, it's clear that the rotational speed of the propeller blades is also proportional to $v$. This means that the output power of the motor is proportional to the product of $\\boldsymbol{F}$ and $v$ and so $P \\propto \\rho v^{3}$. In our considerations, the output power of the drone is fixed so $v \\propto \\rho^{-1 / 3}$ and $F \\propto \\rho\\left(\\rho^{-1 / 3}\\right)^{2}=$ $\\rho^{1 / 3}$. From force balance, $F=m_{\\text {tot }} g$. Hence, $m_{\\text {tot }} \\propto \\rho^{1 / 3}$. Evaluating the ratio at $z=0$ and $z=z_{\\text {max }}$, one gets\n\n$$\n\\frac{1.5 m}{m}=\\left(\\frac{\\rho(0)}{\\rho\\left(z_{\\max }\\right)}\\right)^{1 / 3}=\\left(1-\\frac{g z_{\\max }}{c_{p} T_{0}}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{3(\\gamma-1)}}\n$$\n\nand so\n\n$$\nz_{\\max }=\\frac{c_{p} T_{0}}{g}\\left(1-1.5^{-3(\\gamma-1)}\\right)=11.3 \\mathrm{~km}\n$$",

After the velocity $v$ of the disc becomes on the order of $v_{0}=\\sqrt{k_{B} T_{0} / m}$, the flux of molecules reaching the backside $j(v)$ decays faster than exponentially due to the nature of the molecular velocity distribution in the ideal gas (for example, $j\\left(2 v_{0}\\right) \\approx 10^{-3} j_{0}$ and $j\\left(3 v_{0}\\right) \\approx 10^{-6} j_{0}$ ).

        "solution": "When the stone is thrown vertically upwards, it can reach the point $x=0, z=v_{0}^{2} / 2 g$ (as it follows from the energy conservation law). Comparing this with the inequality $z \\leq z_{0}-k x^{2}$ we conclude that\n\n$$\nz_{0}=v_{0}^{2} / 2 g\n$$\n\nLet us consider the asymptotics $z \\rightarrow-\\infty$; the trajectory of the stone is a parabola, and at this limit, the horizontal displacement (for the given $z$ ) is very sensitive with respect to the curvature of the parabola: the flatter the parabola, the larger the displacement. The parabola has the flattest shape when the stone is thrown horizontally, $x=v_{0} t$ and $z=-g t^{2} / 2$, i.e. its trajectory is given by $z=-g x^{2} / 2 v_{0}^{2}$. Now, let us recall that $z \\leq z_{0}-k x^{2}$, i.e. $-g x^{2} / 2 v_{0}^{2} \\leq z_{0}-k x^{2} \\Rightarrow k \\leq g / 2 v_{0}^{2}$. Note that $k<g / 2 v_{0}^{2}$ would imply that there is a gap between the parabolic region $z \\leq z_{0}-k x^{2}$ and the given trajectory $z=-g x^{2} / 2 v_{0}^{2}$. This trajectory is supposed to be optimal for hitting targets far below $(z \\rightarrow-\\infty)$, so there should be no such a gap, and hence, we can exclude the option $k<g / 2 v_{0}^{2}$. This leaves us with\n\n$$\nk=g / 2 v_{0}^{2}\n$$",

So, we can obtain $r_{A} r_{B} /\\left(r_{A}+r_{B}\\right)=r_{C} r_{D} /\\left(r_{C}+r_{D}\\right)=$ We can now plug equations (2) and (1) into (5) $2.337 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\pm 27.4 \\Omega$, hence $\\langle r\\rangle=4.674 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega \\pm 55 \\Omega$ to express $\\omega_{i+1}$ in terms of $\\omega_{i}$.\n\n$$\n\\omega_{i+1}=\\frac{2}{5} \\omega_{i}^{\\prime}=\\frac{2}{5} \\sqrt{\\omega_{i}^{2}+\\frac{3 g}{\\ell}\\left(1-\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nBy stability, $\\omega_{i}=\\omega_{i+1}=\\omega$.

        "solution": "Let the $x$-axis be the diameter $A B$, with coordinates chosen to be in meters, and with the coordinates of $A$ being $(-R, 0)$. (So the coordinates of $B$ are $(R, 0)$ and the coordinates of $C$ are $(0,-(R-h))$. The unique parabola $y=a x^{2}+b x+c$ that goes through these three points has $b=0$ from symmetry across the $y$ axis, $c=-(R-h)$ from condsidering the point $C$, and then $a=-\\frac{R-h}{R^{2}}$ from considering the point $A$. The derivative at $A$ is $\\left.\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right|_{x=-R}=2 a \\cdot R=-\\frac{2(R-h)}{R}$, from which\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\cos \\alpha & =\\frac{-d y}{\\sqrt{(d y)^{2}+(d x)^{2}}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{d x}{d y}\\right)^{2}}} \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\frac{R^{2}}{4(R-h)^{2}}}} \\approx 0.7106 .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nUsing the equations from parts (iv) and (v), we now have a system of equations in two unknowns:\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\nT_{A}-T_{C}=-\\frac{\\lambda 2 \\pi^{2} h(2 R-h)}{\\tau^{2}} \\\\\nR T_{A} \\cdot 0.7106=(R-h) T_{C}\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nIt remains to solve this system of equations.

Gossard (here we neglect the thickness of the two-dimensional electron layer). A strong uniform magnetic field $B$ was applied perpendicular to the two-dimensional electron system. As illustrated in Figure 1, when a current $I$ was passing through the sample, the voltage $V_{\\mathrm{H}}$ across the current path exhibited an unexpected quantized plateau (corresponding to a Hall resistance $R_{\\mathrm{H}}=$ $3 h / e^{2}$ ) at sufficiently low temperatures. The appearance of the plateau would imply the presence of fractionally charged quasiparticles in the system, which we analyze below. For simplicity, we neglect the scattering of the electrons by random potential, as well as the electron spin.\n\nIn a classical model, two-dimensional electrons behave like charged billiard balls on a table.

C. Gossard (here we neglect the thickness of the two-dimensional electron layer). A strong uniform magnetic field $B$ was applied perpendicular to the two-dimensional electron system.

        "solution": "Solution 1. We can solve the problem exactly, approximating only in the last step. This certainly isn't necessary; we do this to illustrate a useful technique. We set $c=1$ throughout, and transform to an inertial frame where the proton is initially at rest. Before the collision,\n\n$$\nE_{p}=m_{p}, \\quad E_{\\gamma}=\\left|p_{\\gamma}\\right| .\n$$\n\nFor the $\\Delta$ particle, we have the usual relativistic relation\n\n$$\nE_{\\Delta}^{2}=p_{\\Delta}^{2}+m_{\\Delta}^{2} \\text {. }\n$$\n\nBy energy-momentum conservation,\n\n$$\nE_{p}+E_{\\gamma}=E_{\\Delta}, \\quad p_{\\gamma}=p_{\\Delta} .\n$$\n\nCombining these results gives\n\n$$\n\\left(m_{p}+E_{\\gamma}\\right)^{2}=E_{\\gamma}^{2}+m_{\\Delta}^{2} \\Rightarrow E_{\\gamma}=\\frac{m_{\\Delta}^{2}-m_{p}^{2}}{2 m_{p}}\n$$\n\nNow we need to transform back to the original frame, where the energy of the photon is $E_{b}$. We can use the Lorentz transformation for this, but it's a little easier to realize that $E=h f$ for photons, and apply the Doppler shift. Then\n\n$$\n\\alpha \\equiv \\frac{E_{b}}{E_{\\gamma}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\beta}{1+\\beta}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\beta$ is the velocity parameter of the proton in the inertial frame where the photon has energy $E_{b}$. Solving for $\\beta$ in terms of the energy ratio $\\alpha$,\n\n$$\n\\beta=\\frac{1-\\alpha^{2}}{1+\\alpha^{2}}\n$$\n\nTo calculate the proton energy, we need the Lorentz factor,\n\n$$\n\\gamma=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^{2}}}=\\frac{1+\\alpha^{2}}{2 \\alpha}\n$$\n\nThen the proton energy in the original frame is\n\n$$\nE_{p}=\\gamma m_{p}=\\frac{m_{p}}{2}\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right)=\\frac{m_{p}}{2}\\left(\\frac{2 m_{p} E_{b}}{m_{\\Delta}^{2}-m_{p}^{2}}+\\frac{m_{\\Delta}^{2}-m_{p}^{2}}{2 m_{p} E_{b}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich is the exact answer.\n\nAt this point, we can approximate. The second term is much larger than the first, so\n\n$$\nE_{p} \\approx \\frac{m_{\\Delta}^{2}-m_{p}^{2}}{4 E_{b}}\n$$\n\nwhich was the required answer for this problem.\n\nSolution 2. We now show another method that approximates throughout. We'll do everything in the lab frame, so the symbols in this solution don't mean the same things they did in solution 1. In the lab frame, energy-momentum conservation gives\n\n$$\np_{p}-p_{b}=p_{\\Delta}, \\quad E_{p}+E_{b}=E_{\\Delta} .\n$$\n\nSquaring both expressions and dropping $E_{b}^{2}$ terms, since $E_{b}$ is small,\n\n$$\np_{p}^{2}-2 p_{p} p_{b} \\approx p_{\\Delta}^{2}, \\quad E_{p}^{2}+2 E_{p} E_{b} \\approx E_{\\Delta}^{2}\n$$\n\nSubtracting these equations gives\n\n$$\nm_{p}^{2}+2 E_{p} E_{b}+2 p_{p} E_{b}=m_{\\Delta}^{2} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad E_{p}+p_{p}=\\frac{m_{\\Delta}^{2}-m_{p}^{2}}{2 E_{b}}\n$$\n\nSince $E_{b}$ is small, this quantity must be large. But this means the protons are ultrarelativistic, so $E_{p} \\approx p_{p}$, giving\n\n$$\nE_{p} \\approx \\frac{m_{\\Delta}^{2}-m_{p}^{2}}{4 E_{b}}\n$$\n\nas desired.",

One could then compute $P_{w} / P$ with a calculator at a few trial values such as $x=0.5,0.7,0.9$, which are already enough to get the desired accuracy.\n\nThe optimum value is $x=0.69$, at which point\n\n$$\nP_{w}^{\\max }=0.077 P .\n$$\n\nHence in this model, at most $7.7 \\%$ of solar energy can be converted into wind energy. Any answer within $15 \\%$ of this value was accepted.",
