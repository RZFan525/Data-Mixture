        "problem": "Gabi was happy with how much the students enjoyed asking her questions. One tricky question was asked by Jett. He explained to her and the class that his grandfather works in a coal mine where the coal seams are known to be Permian in age. Sometimes his grandfather brings Jett interesting fossils that have been found in the mine. Jett wanted to know how it could be that between two layers of coal, which are formed from land-plant remains accumulating on the floor of a swamp, there was a layer of siltstone full of shells called brachiopods. In one large specimen, a group of brachiopods are clearly in their original life-position, along with some sea urchin and coral fossils. Before answering, Gabi gave each student the chance to propose an answer.\n\nGabi's answer requires no additional information for it to be a plausible explanation of how a layer of siltstone with brachiopods in it could be deposited between two layers of Permian period black coal. Which answer aligns with Gabis solution?\nA: Jett thought it might be because some brachiopods live in freshwater. He suggested that during a brief change in climate the area became wetter, with the deeper river water drowning the land plants and providing a good environment for fresh-water brachiopods before once again drying out and returning to the swampy conditions that favoured the plants.\nB: Amber thought that brachiopods are only known to live in marine environments so the best explanation would be that a marine transgression occurred, drowning the swamp in sea water and allowing brachiopods to flourish before the sea regressed and the area returned to a plant-friendly swamp.\nC: Jasper suggested that the siltstone was the result of humans harvesting brachiopods from the near-by seashore and eating them in a swampy clearing. The discarded brachiopod shells were thrown in a pile and slowly buried in erosional silt from the human activity. After over-exploiting this resource the humans abandoned the area and it returned to being a plant dominated swamp.\nD: Gemma proposed that siltstone never occurs in the same sequence as coal, so the only possible explanation is a series of undocumented low angle thrust faults that have moved the siltstone into position between the coal seams. This would explain the unusual occurrence of siltstone and marine fossils with non-marine coal seams but extra mapping is needed to find the faults.\nE: Gretal thought the brachiopod rich siltstone might be the result of the erosion of a Cretaceous brachiopod-rich sediment in the highlands.

Blindfold Cave fossils are also mostly articulated skeletons but show lots of tooth marks.\nE: Fossils found in both caves are fully disarticulated remains but only Graymalkin Cave was a nursery den for Thylacaleo carnifex, a large marsupial carnivore.\n\nYou can solve it step by step.\nPlease end your response with: \"The final answer is $\\boxed{ANSWER}$\", where ANSWER should be one of the options: [A, B, C, D, E].",

        "problem": "Gemma was curious to know why her favourite mineral, diamond, is easily broken into pieces along planes of weakness, known as cleavage planes, when it is also known as the hardest of all the natural minerals (according to Mohs hardness scale which tests how difficult it is to scratch a material). Gabi's explanation to Gemma was:\nA: Diamond's carbon atoms are packed into a crystal lattice where they are covalently bonded to each other to form a very strong structure that resists scratching better than anything else in nature. However, because of the way the atoms are packed, along certain planes within the crystal, there are less covalent bonds than other planes and those with less bonds are a little weaker than the rest, allowing the crystal to be broken along them.\nB: Diamond's carbon atoms are packed into a crystal lattice where they are hydrogen bonded to each other to form a very strong structure that resists scratching better than anything else in nature. Cleavage in diamonds only happens when there are lots of impurities on planes known as Jeweller's Friends.\nC: Diamond's carbon atoms are packed into a crystal lattice where they are ionically bonded to each other to form a very strong structure that resists scratching better than anything else in nature. However, along certain planes within the crystal there are some covalent bonds and those with covalent bonds are a little weaker than the rest and allow the crystal to be broken along them.\nD: Pure-carbon diamonds don't break.

Gabi's explanation to Gemma was:\n\nA: Diamond's carbon atoms are packed into a crystal lattice where they are covalently bonded to each other to form a very strong structure that resists scratching better than anything else in nature. However, because of the way the atoms are packed, along certain planes within the crystal, there are less covalent bonds than other planes and those with less bonds are a little weaker than the rest, allowing the crystal to be broken along them.\nB: Diamond's carbon atoms are packed into a crystal lattice where they are hydrogen bonded to each other to form a very strong structure that resists scratching better than anything else in nature.
