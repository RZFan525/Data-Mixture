One such material contains yttrium, barium, copper and oxygen and is called \"YBCO\". It has a nominal composition of $\\mathrm{YBa}_{2} \\mathrm{Cu}_{3} \\mathrm{O}_{7}$, but its actual composition is variable according to the formula $\\mathrm{YBa}_{2} \\mathrm{Cu}_{3} \\mathrm{O}_{7-\\delta}$ $(0<\\delta<0.5)$.\n\nTwo identical samples of YBCO with an unknown value of $\\delta$ were prepared. The first sample was dissolved in $5 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of aqueous $\\mathrm{HCl}\\left(c=1.0 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{dm}^{-3}\\right)$, evolving $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$. After boiling to expel gases, cooling, and addition of $10 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of $\\mathrm{KI}$ solution ( $c=0.7 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{dm}^{-3}$ ) under Ar, titration with thiosulfate to the starch endpoint required $1.542 \\cdot 10^{-4}$ mol thiosulfate. The second sample of YBCO was added under Ar directly to $7 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of a solution in which $c(\\mathrm{KI})=1.0 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{dm}^{-3}$ and $\\mathrm{c}(\\mathrm{HCl})=0.7 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{dm}^{-3}$. Titration of this solution required $1.696 \\cdot 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~mol}$ thiosulfate to reach the endpoint.\n\nproblem:\nCalculate the value of $\\delta$ for these samples of YBCO.\n\nAll mathematical formulas and symbols you output should be represented with LaTeX!\nYou can solve it step by step.\nPlease end your response with: \"The final answer is $\\boxed{ANSWER}$\", where ANSWER is the numerical value.",

The preparation of $\\mathrm{SkCl}_{4}$ was first described over four hundred years ago, but its formation may well have been described earlier and may have been one of the winged dragons referred to by the alchemists.\n\nAqueous $\\mathrm{SkCl}_{2}$ is easily prepared by dissolving metallic stuck-at-homium in dilute hydrochloric acid. On evaporation, the dihydrate is produced, $\\mathrm{SkCl}_{2} \\cdot 2 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$. This can be dehydrated to give anhydrous $\\mathrm{SkCl}_{2}$ using ethanoic anhydride, $\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{CO}\\right)_{2} \\mathrm{O}$. The structure of solid anhydrous $\\mathrm{SkCl}_{2}$ consists of chains of $\\mathrm{SkCl}_{2}$ units in which there are two different $\\mathrm{Sk}-\\mathrm{Cl}$ bond lengths and two different chlorine environments. The anhydrous solid melts and then boils at a temperature less than $700^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\n\nTo prepare $\\mathrm{SkCl}_{4}$ from $\\mathrm{SkCl}_{2}$, an oxidising agent must be used. One preparation uses $\\mathrm{HgCl}_{2}$. Mercury forms two chlorides: $\\mathrm{HgCl}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$.\n\nGive TWO different equations for the preparation of $\\mathrm{SkCl}_{4}$ from $\\mathrm{SkCl}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{HgCl}_{2}$.\n\nAll mathematical formulas and symbols you output should be represented with LaTeX!\nYou can solve it step by step.\nTheir answer types are, in order, [expression, expression].\nPlease end your response with: \"The final answers are \\boxed{ANSWER}\", where ANSWER should be the sequence of your final answers, separated by commas, for example: 5, 7, 2.5",

The reason for the uncertainty is that naturally occurring tellurium is a mix of 8 different isotopes whose proportions can vary depending on the sample. In contrast, naturally occurring iodine consists of a single isotope - iodine 127 - and so its relative mass is known to a high precision: $126.904472 \\pm 0.000003$.\n\nThe heaviest of the isotopes found in naturally-occurring tellurium is tellurium- 130 which has a relative mass of 129.906223 . Technically, tellurium-130 is very slightly radioactive and if there were none in the naturally occurring element, the relative atomic mass of tellurium would be 126.412449 (which would make it less than iodine).\n\nCalculate the percentage of tellurium-130 present in naturally-occurring tellurium.\n\nAll mathematical formulas and symbols you output should be represented with LaTeX!\nYou can solve it step by step.\nRemember, your answer should be calculated in the unit of %, but when concluding your final answer, do not include the unit.\nPlease end your response with: \"The final answer is $\\boxed{ANSWER}$\", where ANSWER is the numerical value without any units.",

Unlike our modern tables, in this version the Groups of elements are arranged in horizontal rows.\n\nSince the structure of the atom was completely unknown at the time, there was no concept of atomic number and the elements were ordered by their atomic masses. The numbers shown in the table are the atomic masses as known at the time. Before the 1860s, atomic masses were not accurate enough for all the trends and patterns in any arrangement of the elements to be discovered.\n\nMendeleev's table is pretty impressive, but there are a number of errors...\nОІЫТ'Б СПСТЕМЫ ЭЛЕМЕНТОВ'Ь,\n\nОСНОВАННОӤ НА ИХ'Ъ АТОМНОМ'Ъ ВТСТ И ХНМИЧЕСКОМ'b СХОДСТВЪ.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ti}=50 \\quad \\mathrm{Zr}=90 \\quad ?=180 .\n$$\n\n$\\mathrm{V}=-51 \\quad \\mathrm{Nb}=94 \\quad \\mathrm{Ta}=182$\n\n$\\mathrm{Cr}=52 \\quad \\mathrm{M}=-96 \\quad \\mathrm{~W}=186$.\n\n$\\mathrm{Mn}-55 \\mathrm{Rh}=104,4 \\mathrm{Pl}=197$,\n\nFe $=56 \\quad \\mathrm{R} \\|=104,4 \\quad \\mathrm{Ir}-198$.\n\n$\\mathrm{Ni}=\\mathrm{Co}=59 \\quad \\mathrm{P}=106, \\mathrm{i}$ Os -199.\n\n$\\mathrm{H}=1 \\quad \\mathrm{Cu}=63,4 \\quad \\mathrm{Ag}=108 \\quad \\mathrm{Hg}=200$. $\\mathrm{Be}-9,4 \\mathrm{Mg}=24 \\quad \\mathrm{Zn}=65,2 \\mathrm{Cd}=112$\n\n$\\mathrm{B}=11 \\quad \\mathrm{Al}=27,4 \\quad ?=68 . \\mathrm{Ur}=116 \\quad \\mathrm{~A} \\|=197$ ?\n\n$\\mathrm{C}=12 \\quad \\mathrm{Si}=28 \\quad ?=70 \\quad \\mathrm{Sn}=118$\n\n$\\mathrm{N}=14 \\quad \\mathrm{P}=31 \\quad \\mathrm{As}=75 \\quad \\mathrm{Sb}=122 \\quad \\mathrm{Bi}=210$ ?\n\n$0=16 \\quad \\mathrm{~S}=32 \\mathrm{Se}=79,4 \\mathrm{Te}=128$ ?\n\n$\\mathrm{F}=19 \\quad \\mathrm{Cl}=35,5 \\mathrm{Br} \\cdots 80 \\quad \\mathrm{I}=127$\n\n$\\mathrm{Li}=7 \\mathrm{Na}=23 \\quad \\mathrm{~K}=39 \\mathrm{Rb}=85,4 \\quad \\mathrm{Cs}-133 \\quad \\mathrm{Tl}=204$.\n\nCa $=40 \\quad \\mathrm{Sr} \\Rightarrow 57, ; \\quad \\mathrm{Ba}=137 \\quad \\mathrm{~Pb}=207$.\n\n$?=45 \\mathrm{Ce}=92$\n\n?Er $=56 \\quad \\mathrm{La}=94$\n\n? $\\mathrm{Yl}=60 \\quad \\mathrm{Di}=95$\n\n? $\\mathbf{n}=75, \\mathbf{T} \\mathbf{T h}=118 ?$\n\n##  electron configurations\n\nWe now know that elements in the same Group of the periodic table have similar properties because they have the same number of electrons in their outermost (valence) shell. In Mendeleev's second table, elements in the same Group have the same number of valence electrons, even though some elements are from the main block of the periodic table, and some from the transition metals.\n\nOur modern periodic table is based on the electronic configurations of the elements.\n\nFor elements from Groups 1 and 2, the valence electrons are in $s$ orbitals whereas for elements in Groups 13-18, they are in $s$ and $p$ orbitals. In both cases the orbitals have principal quantum numbers the same as the period number.\n\nFor elements in Groups 3-12, the electrons are filling d orbitals in shells with principal quantum numbers one less that the period number. The valence electrons are the s electrons and perhaps some / all of the d electrons.\n\nFor the lanthanoids and actinoids, the electrons are filling $f$ orbitals in shells with principal quantum numbers two less than the period number.\n\n Give the full electron configurations of calcium in s, p, d notation.\n\nAll mathematical formulas and symbols you output should be represented with LaTeX!\nYou can solve it step by step.\nPlease end your response with: \"The final answer is $\\boxed{ANSWER}$\", where ANSWER is an expression without equals signs, e.g. ANSWER=\\frac{1}{2} g t^2",

This can be dehydrated to give anhydrous $\\mathrm{SkCl}_{2}$ using ethanoic anhydride, $\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{CO}\\right)_{2} \\mathrm{O}$. The structure of solid anhydrous $\\mathrm{SkCl}_{2}$ consists of chains of $\\mathrm{SkCl}_{2}$ units in which there are two different $\\mathrm{Sk}-\\mathrm{Cl}$ bond lengths and two different chlorine environments. The anhydrous solid melts and then boils at a temperature less than $700^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\n\nTo prepare $\\mathrm{SkCl}_{4}$ from $\\mathrm{SkCl}_{2}$, an oxidising agent must be used. One preparation uses $\\mathrm{HgCl}_{2}$. Mercury forms two chlorides: $\\mathrm{HgCl}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$.\n\n $\\mathrm{SkCl}_{4}$ smokes in air because it reacts with water vapour. In the simplest equation for this reaction, an oxide of stuck-at-homium is formed and one other product. Give an equation for this reaction.\n\nAll mathematical formulas and symbols you output should be represented with LaTeX!\nYou can solve it step by step.\nPlease end your response with: \"The final answer is $\\boxed{ANSWER}$\", where ANSWER is an expression without equals signs, e.g. ANSWER=\\frac{1}{2} g t^2",
